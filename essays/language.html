          <p>
            The term <b>"language"</b> means different things to
            different people. This seemingly trite observation is
            often overlooked in discussions of all
            things <em>language</em>. There are many well-intending
            people (especially linguists) on quests to correct
            "misconceptions" about "language" or otherwise spread
            their views about <em>the true nature</em> of "language".
            As it turns out, there is little consensus among language
            researchers at large about what "language" is.
            Furthermore, when specialists <em>do</em> agree on some
            definition, it tends to lie far from laypeople's
            intuitions. For instance, (generative) linguists may talk
            about "<b>'Language' with a Capital 'L'</b>" to
            distinguish <em>the human capacity to use particular
            languages</em> from the particulars of "languages"
            themselves (whatever those are)
          </p>

            I find it useful to think of "language" as <em>any form of
            conventionalized communication</em>. Under such a broad
            definition, "language" include things like gestures and
            body language, symbols and signs, and other forms of
            "non-verbal communication". By my very loose definition
            here, language is not unique to humans and interspecies
            communication happens between you and your pet dog.
            Another place my definition of language here leads to is
            the fact that <em>some languages are more complex than
            others</em>. While this statement may not seem at-face
            controversial to the unindoctrinated, it has become a
            point of pontificating for "social justice" concerned
            academics tied to various forms
            of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/">egalitarian</a>
            ethics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Steer away from discussions about "language" (or
            "society", or "the economy") with those who are not
            willing to define their terms yet maintain strong
            positions. Observe first, describe next, theorize last.
            And then, only if you must, then teach.
