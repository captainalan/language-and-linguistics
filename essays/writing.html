          </div>
          <p>
	        How is it that we <em>look</em> at a bunch of squiggles
            and start hearing noises in our heads?! <em>Or,</em> am I
            assuming how you think&mdash;is not all reading is
            "verbal"?! Writing is a peculiar thing that
            anybody <em>reading</em> this probably takes for granted.
            How very "meta"&mdash;you are reading about reading!
          </p>
          <p>
            That which we call "writing" is a general skill of
            recognizing and interpretting symbols
            presented <span class="term">graphically</span>&mdash;that
            is a <em>spatial</em> (most often 2D) arrangement of
            some <em>stuff</em> into a discernable form. This can be
            in brush strokes, on a digital display, with braille
            dots...
          </p>
          <p>
            One may also speak of <em>writing</em> as in <em>writing
            music</em>, doing a particular type of shot with
            camera/film, or in the case of the Christian
            tradition&mdash;<span class="term">Iconography</span>. How
            writing is done can vary in quality&mdash;hopefully this
            web page is aesthetically pleasing enough üòÅ

          <h3>Linguists on Writing</h3>
          <p>
            A point of dogma for many linguists is that <em>writing
            isn't Language</em> (or some variant of this point). This
            point resonates with many people because of the social
            justice implications of holding this view&mdash;evidently,
            not all people groups have writing systems. So as to not
            say that certain people groups have "more developed"
            language than others, it is necessary to either (1) assert
            that <em>writing isn't language</em> or (2) redefine
            "writing" in such a way that using a writing system is
            nothing special.

          <p>
            Here, we return to a more general field of study than
            "linguistics proper"
            called <span class="term">semiology</span>...
          </p>
 
          <h3>Literate forever</h3>
          <p>
            Writing fundamentally changes how people approach
	        communication. Even if you never touch another book in
	        your life, the idea of "recording speech" is forever in
	        your head. You cannot escape the idea of "alphabetical
	        order".
          </p>
          <p>
            To neglect writing in the study of "language" is like
            trying to study the form of bicycles while ignoring the
            anatomy of human riders and the condition of local roads.
