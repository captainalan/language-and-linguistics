                <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
                <p>
                    Here are language related questions people have asked me.
                    I may turn these questions and answers into essays later.
                </p>
                <h3>Are emojis "language"?</h3>
                <p>
                    I would say, <em>yes</em> for people that consistently
                    use them with particular meanings. Ad-hoc usage is not.
                    What is really crucial here is how a person understands the term
                    "language".
                </p>

                <h3>Should I study linguistics?</h3>
                <p>
                    Learn these things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="term">International Phonetic
                            Alphabet</span>&mdash;if you learn the meanings of the
                        different things on the official chart
                        (e.g. <b>voiced</b> vs <b>unvoiced</b>
                        consonants, <b>aspiration</b>, etc.), you will have a
                        good technical basis to learning how to pronounce any
                        language reasonable well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="term">Grammar</span>&mdash;choose at least
                        one European language and learn it well. Why a European
                        language? Much of how we talk about grammar comes from
                        teaching Latin and Greek. You should become familiar
                        with things like (1) parts of speech, (2) formal
                        (pertaining to the <em>form</em> of words) distinctions
                        like <b>gender</b>, <b>case</b>, and <b>number</b>, and
                        (3) how different languages describe events (e.g.
                        through the use of <b>tense</b> and <b>aspect</b>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A good introduction to linguistics course will take you
                    through all of these things. However, mastery of these
                    things will require time and attention on your
                    part&mdash;these are things a class can't give.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practice and use use at least one foreign language to
                    understand the struggles that go into acquiring an
                    unfamliar way of speaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After doing these things, you can then ask yourself again
                    if you should go and study (more) linguistics.
                </p>
