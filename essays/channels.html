            It is not uncommon to hear statements being thrown around like,
            "this would be easier face-to-face" or "texting isn't the same as
            talking". Such declarations are rooted in the observation that
            different <b>channels</b> of communication excel at different
            things. In this essay I will provide a model for categorizing different
            channels of communication and show how this model can make
            predictions about what sort of channels are good for what sort of
            things, and at what cost.
          </p>

            Upon finishing reading this essay, you should have some useful
            concepts for discussing questions like,
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Why does email remain such a popular choice for communication in businesses?</li>
            <li>Why do I feel like I'm always replying to text messages?</li>
            <li>When is it a good idea to <em>talk</em> about something, rather than write about it?</li>
            <li>Should cursive writing be taught in schools?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My main goal with this essay is <em>practical</em>. Through the
            exercise of characterizing various forms of communications, I hope
            we can all make more effective decisions in choosing <em>how</em>
            we communicate with each other by choosing channels well-suited for
            our purposes.
          </p>

          <h2>Characterizing Channels of Communication</h2>
          <p>
            Communication can be described in a handful of dimensions. First,
            we can distinguish how the events of communication occur in time.
            I'll call this the <b>temporal nature</b> of a system of
            communication. We can characterize the <b>content</b> of
            communication events, noting that some channels allow more diverse,
            richer information than others. We can also characterize the
            <b>"staying"</b> or permanence of communication events.  Finally,
            we end with a discussion of how different <b>interlocutors</b>
            affect communication, e.g. social relations between different
            people, human and computer interactions.

          </p>

          <h3>Temporal Nature</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Real-time</b> communication is like talking face to face or chatting
            over the phone. There is no fixed order of who talks when, limited
            only by manners. Both people could should at each other continually
            as in a political debate with a bad moderator and uncooperative
            candidates.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Asynchronous</b> communication is like text messaging or using a
            similar functioning chat application. Communication is comprised of
            discrete events (i.e. you can count how many times different people
            write stuff; this is not always clear in speech), but users create
            these events in a not-agreed-upon order. By definition,
            interlocutors never "interrupt" each other in the sense that
            messages will always appear in sequence; even if two people post
            something at <em>almost</em> the same time, the system governing
            this communication (e.g. Facebook messenger) will decide who sent
            their message first and thus which message appears first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we have <b>turn-based</b> communication where there is a fixed
            order by which exchanges happen. Two friends may pass notes back in
            forth at a regular interval, for instance.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can categorize all sorts of ways people communicate into these
            three types of systems. For example, playing a game of chess is a
            type of turn-based communication. Playing Starcraft, a real-time
            strategy game, is technically asynchronous (as it has to be
            processed by a computer), but gameplay will appear real-time
            because players are doing all sorts of things at
            once&mdash;gathering resources, flaming their teammates for being
            st00pid, etc. Posting blogs is a form of asynchronous communication
            where blog posts become available to read as authors publish them.
          </p>

          <h3>Content</h3>
          <p>
	    Face-to-face "traditional" communication is famously <em>rich</em>
	    in its expressed content. In addition to words which may be copied
	    down into writing, there are facial expressions and body language.
	    Beyond this, there is also fashion ("dress for success"),
	    bodily/physical appearance, gender dynamics and all sorts of other
	    factors that influence face-to-face interactions.  All of these
	    things combined form the "richness" of this channel of
	    communication.
	  </p>
          <p>
	    On the other hand, many forms of text-based communication are
	    fairly limited, often by technical constraints. For example, an
	    online message board may allow users to post messages, do some text
	    formatting (e.g. <b>bolding</b> and <i>italicizing</i>) and have an
	    avatar/profile picture. There is a "equalization" that happens
			    between users; as the old saying goes <i><a
					    href="for instance we know nothing
					    of the physical height of the
					    ">nobody knows if you are a dog on
					    the Internet</a></i>.

          </p>
	  <p>
	    Some channels are very restrictive on the types of things you are
	    able to communicate. For instance, in many games, you are only
	    allowed to say a small collection of pre-written messages (saw this
	    on a friend's Nintendo switch). Rudeness and stuff is censored by
	    having a very content-restricted channel. On the other hand, using
	    some video communication software like Skype or Zoom, you are given
	    lots of creative freedom, comparable to face-to-face interactions
	    mediated by a glass screen.
	  </p>

          <h3>"Staying" Power</h3>

	  <p>
	    Communication events "stay around" longer in some systems compared
	    to others. Communication channels like Twitter can be searched and
	    archived. "Lawyering" trolls can play whack-a-quote to beat you
	    into submission according to ill-defined terms of service and codes
	    of conduct.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    On the other hand, face-to-face communication in its fullness is
	    ephemeral. Even a recording of a face-to-face interaction does not
	    capture everything about the communication event. New tech like 3D
	    scans and Virtual Reality technology may make people able to create
	    increasingly face-to-face like interactions that <em>also have
	    staying power</em>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    "Staying" Power is a characteristic that is helpful some of the
	    time, and to be avoided in other circumstances.  Historically, many
	    people have wanted their old letters/communications destroyed.  To
	    communicate over long distances, they needed to use written
	    communication (e.g. letters), though they may have preferred a more
	    ephemeral medium. Going into the 21st century, discussion about
	  </p>

          <h2>Choosing Channels</h2>

          <p>
	    Often, what channels are best for communication depend on
            <em>what people are most familiar or competent in</em>. For this
            reason, spoken, face-to-face communication is often best. This is a
            "default" channel of communication for most people.
          </p>

	  <h4>Nerds on the Internet</h4>
	  <p>
	    Note that some people may feel more comfortable with
	    non-face-to-face channels of communication. For instance, nerds on
	    the Internet may prefer to use reddit to argue so that more
	    muscular fraternity-bro looking types cannot intimidate them.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Many nerds relish in the fact that they can type very quickly.
	    Online, they believe they appear they are quick-thinking and
	    perceptive because they can conjure paragraphs with fast
	    finger-flicks.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The nerd thrives in a text environment&mdash;hiding behind an anime
	    profile picture&mdash;because it is here that many of their weak
	    points can be hidden and their strengths (such as abnormal
	    tolerance for arbitrariness, encyclopedic knowledge of the
	    esoteric) can be amplified.

	  </p>

          <h4>Handwriting is an indispensible tool for many productive people</h4>
          <p>
            The pen-and-paper written medium is different from typing on a
            computer (in who-knows-what software). So to tell children that it
            isn't important to learn (cursive) handwriting because they can
            just use a computer is a narrow-viewed, short-sighted choice.
            The medium of pen-and-paper affords freedoms (continuous rather than
            discrete) without much technical overhead&mdash;it is often much easier
            to recover from the tip of a pencil breaking than a system crash,
            or some security policy locking away your access to some files.
            Furthermore, you don't have to struggle through terrible UIs,
            menus, buttons and the like to figure out stuff like making a
            bulleted list, drawing a table, etc.

		  <h3>Negative Examples: What <em>not</em> to do</h3>

		  <p>
		    Choosing improper channels is a recipe for frustration and fatigue.
		  </p>

		  <h4>Grocery Lists by Voice</h4>
		  <p>
		    I've seen sad Chinese students listening to roommates reciting
		    grocery lists, holding their phone up to their ear and repeatedly
		    playing back the same message. I think this is pretty dumb channel
		    usage; why not have a list written out you can visually refer to?
