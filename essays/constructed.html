          <p>
            This essay explores the notion of "artificial" or "constructed"
            languages, such as Esperanto and lojban. The thing I'm talking about
            have also been called "conlangs".
          </p>
          <p>
            My basic conclusion is that the distinction between "Artificial"
            Languages and
            <b>"natural languages"</b> is ultimately an exercise in
            <b>anti-Nationalism</b>. Artificial languages are languages that
            lack a nation. They also more often than not lack "native speakers".
            They reflect an attempt by "<a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdRJMuOFO88"
              >Bugmen</a

            and other trends in cosmopolitan, urban society&mdash;to enjoy the
            fruits of nationalism without being a metaphorical Nazi. While
            pretending to be Klingon, a "global citizen", "logical" or something
            else, having your own language to

            in legitimizes your identity.

          </p>
          <h2>Of LARPing and "Language"</h2>
          <p>
            To begin, I will define what I mean by "language". A
            <b>language</b> is a standardized system of communication.
            Standardization usually means having a set of well-defined, discrete
            tokens&mdash;these may be called "words". A language is shared
            conventions about how these words may be formed, how these words may
            be ordered, and how these words may be used in larger units.
            Linguists will call what I just described "<b>morphology</b>",
            "<b>syntax</b>", and "<b>pragmatics</b>", respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Academics in the social sciences may try to define "language" in
            terms of wishy-washy psychological this-and-that. Ultimately, they
            just want to <em>ground</em> their notion of "language" in something
            physical so they can count themselves as doing something comparable
            to the natural sciences. It is left as an
            <a
              href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/exercise+for+the+reader"
              >exercise to the reader</a
            >
            to judge whether or not they have been successful in this endeavor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Language is ultimately a human, socially defined thing. Just
            <em>how</em> a given language is formed differs for every language.
            For example, many languages have grown up alongside some written
            system, such as Chinese. Idioms, expressions, and all sorts of other
            stuff interfaces with how these languages are written. Other
            languages haven't had much of a written tradition&mdash;you can look
            at which languages Protestant missionaries created writing systems
            for (e.g. many "indigenous" languages, languages of Africa) to see
            languages that didn't really have writing systems. Nonetheless,
            these "languages" count as languages in that there were oral (<em
              >read:</em
            >
            non-written) ways standards/norms were defined, thus defining
            systems of human communication (-> languages).
          </p>
          <p>
            "Artificial" languages have their own histories too&mdash;they are
            the history of <em>top-down design</em>&mdash;the attempt to
            <em>engineer language</em>. More often than not, these histories are
            not tied to a particular (self-reproducing) people group or
            particularly successful line of descent. The bastard children bugmen
            make artificial languages to construct a cultural heritage they were
            never part of. Since they can't be bothered to acknowledge their own
            heritage, they engage in LARPing via language construction.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now, a few case studies:
          </p>

          <div class="example-box mb-4">
            <h3>GlobalistË™û</h3>
            <p>
              Constructed languages are often a LARPing exercise in Globalist<i
                >-go</i
              >
              (<i>-go</i> is how you say such-and-such <em>language</em> in
              Japanese). Esperanto&mdash;the most successful Artificial
              language&mdash; tries to be a catch-all auxiliary language that
              <em>does</em> everything European languages do without the
              nationalist connotations and irregular nouns/verbs/etc. Speaking
              and writing Esperanto is LARPing the European Union dream.
            </p>

            <h3>Klingon, Elvish, and other ethno-racial languages</h3>
            <p>
              These are unapologetic LARPing languages. You can pretend to
              identify with a fictional race/ethnicity. If only it was
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_OK_to_be_white"
                >"okay to be white"</a
              >!!! üò± Unable to accept that they might be called "racist" for
              embracing some national language and its history, bugmen LARP with
              surrogate artificial languages.
            </p>
            <h3>Fedora Speak</h3>
            <p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">lojban</a> tries to
              be "logical". What does that mean? As I understand it, basically
              it means reducing normal human communication to painfully explicit
              declarative statements. It is the
              <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Bed-Procrustes-Philosophical-Practical-Aphorisms/dp/0812982401"
                >Bed of Procrustes</a
              >
              of language; an experiment in confounding clear articulation with
              excessive specification. All the while, being "international (read
              <em>globalist</em>) by drawing roots from a bunch of existing
              world languages to try to not be European. Pah!"
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>The Classification of Languages</h2>
          <p>
            Distinguishing "Artificial" languages is an exercise in language
            classification. As indicated above, I basically consider Artificial
            languages to be the same as "natural" languages, except that they
            are for nerds rejecting cultural ties and trying hard not to be
            Nazis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Classifying languages means imposing categories to differentiate
            different sorts of languages. For example, a well-known way of
            classifying languages in the world of establishment linguistics is
            looking at VERB and OBJECT placement. In English, we say "I saw a
            cat", where <i>saw</i> is a verb and <i>a cat</i> is an object.
            Thus, we say English is a VO type language. On the other hand, in
            Korean, you would say ÎÇòÎäî Í≥†ÏñëÏù¥Î•º Î¥§Ïñ¥
            <i>na-nun koyangi-lul pwa-ss-e</i> (<a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_romanization_of_Korean"
              >Yale romanization</a
            >) where Í≥†ÏñëÏù¥Î•º <i>koyangi-lul</i> "cat-OBJECT" is the object and
            Î¥§Ïñ¥ <i>pwa-ss-e</i> "saw-PAST-CASUAL" is the verb. Korean is an OV
            ("object, verb") type language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artificial languages can be treated by "traditional" means of
            classification as described above. Insofar as they communicate
            "normal human" semantics, they should be able to be classified on
            normal linguistic parameters. See the
            <a href="https://wals.info/"
              >World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS)</a
            >
            for many examples of these.
          </p>
          <p>
            How Artificial languages mainly differ from "natural" languages is
            ultimately not the final form they take, but rather the culture (or
            lack thereof) that leads to their formation.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Insofar as languages are used by humans to communicate, languages do
            not exist independently of <em>culture</em>. To try to make a human
            (c.f. "natural") language independent of culture is an autistic
            exercise. You should just write a programing language if you want to
            talk with computers. Artificial languages are exercises in trying to
            engineer culture and something like "national languages", without
            being a Nazi.
          </p>

          <h3>Opinion Box</h3>
          <p>
            I do not oppose people using or exploring Artificial languages. I
            also don't really care for the survival or proliferation of
            Artificial languages. We already have immortal Artificial
            languages&mdash;they are called programing languages and are used by
            humans to talk with computers. People talking to people can learn
            other systems&mdash;e.g. national languages like Spanish, Russian,
            and Chinese. For those that want to learn nicely engineered things,
            I would steer away from Artificial languages (failed engineering)
            and instead turn to learning some useful engineering skills (e.g.
            using programing languages) which have their own grammars, jargons,
            etc. Curiously, I have found that the more I care about languages
            that do useful work in the real world, the better people treat me.
            Knowing some Esperanto just made me a sad nerd refraining from
            interjecting my "two cents" whenever language-related topics were
            mentioned in polite company.

              From my definitions here, I don't have much of an opinion on
              questions like "Is Modern Hebrew a natural or artificial
              language?". I consider both of these things species of the same
              "thing" (human communication systems), just with different
              histories. I'll leave evaluating the nation of Israel as an
              exercisd to the reader.
