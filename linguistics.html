          <h1>"Language" and Linguistics</h1>
          <div class="abstract mb-3">
            <p>
              As long as there have been different languages, there
              have been <span class="term">second language
              learners</span>. Likewise, as long as people have
              studied history as it is written, the tradition
              of <span class="term">philology</span> has
              existed&mdash; generations of writers have had to work
              with the differences between their language use and the
              language use of those from other times and places whose
              writings they engage.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="term">Linguistics</span> is a relatively
              new field of study, calling itself the "science of
              language". As the types of studies that fall under the
              umbrella of linguistics are broad in scope and nature it
              would be unfair to categorize linguistics as a whole
              as <span class="term">scientism</span>. Unfortunately,
              we see many people using the pedestal of being
              "scientific" to bolster their own particular views of
              language&mdash;and by extension push their ideas about
              anthropology, psychology, and even spirtuality and
              morality as <em>given</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              My own views on language proceed from a rather
              "traditionalist" view&mdash;languages are many, like
              species of plants and animals. Within languages we can
              observe changes over time, just as we can see families
              growing stronger or becoming weaker. Insofar as a
              families or cultures can standardize their traditions
              and make sure all their members possess certain
              knowledge of signs, so we see the homogeneity or
              heterogeneity of language. All (natural) languages have
              mechanisms for expressing what is shared by all
              humans&mdash;but they also have their differences as we
              observe differences between different groups of people.
              We don't call one language "better" than
              other <em>generally</em>, though certainly we can see
              how particular languages change shape to fit particular
              niches in the world.

            My current main area of interest in language/linguistics has to do with
            the notion of <b>standardization</b> generally, and by extension
            standardized languages.

          <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
          <p>
            Here are language related questions people have asked me.
            I may turn these questions and answers into essays later.
          </p>
          <h3>Are emojis "language"?</h3>
          <p>
            I would say, <em>yes</em> for people that consistently
            use them with particular meanings. Ad-hoc usage is not.
            What is really crucial here is how a person understands the term
            "language".
          </p>
          
          <h3>Should I study linguistics?</h3>
          <p>
            Learn these things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="term">International Phonetic
              Alphabet</span>&mdash;if you learn the meanings of the
              different things on the official chart
              (e.g. <b>voiced</b> vs <b>unvoiced</b>
              consonants, <b>aspiration</b>, etc.), you will have a
              good technical basis to learning how to pronounce any
              language reasonable well.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="term">Grammar</span>&mdash;choose at least
              one European language and learn it well. Why a European
              language? Much of how we talk about grammar comes from
              teaching Latin and Greek. You should become familiar
              with things like (1) parts of speech, (2) formal
              (pertaining to the <em>form</em> of words) distinctions
              like <b>gender</b>, <b>case</b>, and <b>number</b>, and
              (3) how different languages describe events (e.g.
              through the use of <b>tense</b> and <b>aspect</b>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A good introduction to linguistics course will take you
            through all of these things. However, mastery of these
            things will require time and attention on your
            part&mdash;these are things a class can't give.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practice and use use at least one foreign language to
            understand the struggles that go into acquiring an
            unfamliar way of speaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            After doing these things, you can then ask yourself again
            if you should go and study (more) linguistics.
          </p>
