          While my <a href="languages/index.html">languages</a> pages are concerned
          with the specifics of individual languages, this section is about
          <i>languages</i> and human communication, broadly.
          I'm developing a <a href="essays/questions.html">questions and answers</a> page
          to deal with with some topics I've had multiple people ask me about.

        <h2>What are we talking about?</h2>
        <div class="abstract mb-3">
          <p>
            As long as there have been different languages, there
            have been <span class="term">second language
              learners</span>. Likewise, as long as people have
            studied history as it is written, the tradition
            of <span class="term">philology</span> has
            existed&mdash; generations of writers have had to work
            with the differences between their language use and the
            language use of those from other times and places whose
            writings they engage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="term">Linguistics</span> is a relatively
            new field of study, calling itself the "science of
            language". As the types of studies that fall under the
            umbrella of linguistics are broad in scope and nature it
            would be unfair to categorize linguistics as a whole
            as <span class="term">scientism</span>. Unfortunately,
            we see many people using the pedestal of being
            "scientific" to bolster their own particular views of
            language&mdash;and by extension push their ideas about
            anthropology, psychology, and even spirtuality and
            morality as <em>given</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My own views on language proceed from a rather
            "traditionalist" view&mdash;languages are many, like
            species of plants and animals. Within languages we can
            observe changes over time, just as we can see families
            growing stronger or becoming weaker. Insofar as a
            families or cultures can standardize their traditions
            and make sure all their members possess certain
            knowledge of signs, so we see the homogeneity or
            heterogeneity of language. All (natural) languages have
            mechanisms for expressing what is shared by all
            humans&mdash;but they also have their differences as we
            observe differences between different groups of people.
            We don't call one language "better" than
            other <em>generally</em>, though certainly we can see
            how particular languages change shape to fit particular
            niches in the world.

        <h2>Research and Interests</h2>
        <p>
          My current main area of interest in language/linguistics has to do with
          the notion of <b>standardization</b> generally, and by extension
          standardized languages. With empire comes the standardization of weights,
          measures, and also means of communication&mdash;that is, <b>language</b>.
          In the past, how did people think about speech? How is the development
          of literacy (whether for the masses or for learned classes) related
          to how people have thought of language? I aim to investigate these issues
          through looking at how people have used language to talk about language
          across literary genres and ages.

        <h3>Essays</h3>
        <p>
          The work below is not very refined; I plan on developing some writings
          addressing modern (especially mid 20th century onwards) conceptions of
          language and how things like <b>nation states</b>, and the <b>Internet</b>
          have shaped how people think about and use communication.
