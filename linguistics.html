            <p>
              As long as there have been different languages, there
              have been <span class="term">second language
              learners</span>. Likewise, as long as people have
              studied history as it is written, the tradition
              of <span class="term">philology</span> has
              existed&mdash; generations of writers have had to work
              with the differences between their language use and the
              language use of those from other times and places whose
              writings they engage.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="term">Linguistics</span> is a relatively
              new field of study, calling itself the "science of
              language". As the types of studies that fall under the
              umbrella of linguistics are broad in scope and nature it
              would be unfair to categorize linguistics as a whole
              as <span class="term">scientism</span>. Unfortunately,
              we see many people using the pedestal of being
              "scientific" to bolster their own particular views of
              language&mdash;and by extension push their ideas about
              anthropology, psychology, and even spirtuality and
              morality as <em>given</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              My own views on language proceed from a rather
              "traditionalist" view&mdash;languages are many, like
              species of plants and animals. Within languages we can
              observe changes over time, just as we can see families
              growing stronger or becoming weaker. Insofar as a
              families or cultures can standardize their traditions
              and make sure all their members possess certain
              knowledge of signs, so we see the homogeneity or
              heterogeneity of language. All (natural) languages have
              mechanisms for expressing what is shared by all
              humans&mdash;but they also have their differences as we
              observe differences between different groups of people.
              We don't call one language "better" than
              other <em>generally</em>, though certainly we can see
              how particular languages change shape to fit particular
              niches in the world.

          <h2>On the meaning of "Language"</h2>
            <p>
              The term <b>"language"</b> means different things to
              different people. This seemingly trite observation is
              often overlooked in discussions of all
              things <em>language</em>. There are many well-intending
              people (especially linguists)</a> on quests to correct
              "misconceptions" about "language" or otherwise spread
              their views about <em>the true nature</em> of
              "language". As it turns out, there is little consensus
              among language researchers at large about what
              "language" is. Furthermore, when specialists <em>do</em>
              agree on some definition, it tends to lie far from
              laypeople's intuitions. For instance, (generative)
              linguists may talk about "<b>'Language' with a Capital
              'L'</b>" to distinguish <em>the human capacity to use
              particular languages</em> from the particulars of
              "languages" themselves (whatever those are).
            </p>

                <figcaption class="figure-caption">PC caf√© in South Korea &mdash; is language being used here?</figcaption>
            </figure>
 
            <p>
              I find it useful to think of "language" as <em>any form
              of conventionalized communication</em>. Under such a
              broad definition, "language" include things like
              gestures and body language, symbols and signs, and other
              forms of "non-verbal communication". By my very loose
              definition here, language is not unique to humans and
              interspecies communication happens between you and your
              pet dog. Another place my definition of language here
              leads to is the fact that <em>some languages are more
              complex than others</em>. While this statement may not
              seem at-face controversial to the unindoctrinated, it
              has become a point of pontificating for "social justice"
              concerned academics tied to various forms
              of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/">egalitarian</a>
              ethics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Steer away from discussions about "language" (or
              "society", or "the economy") with those who are not
              willing to define their terms yet maintain strong
              positions. Observe first, describe next, theorize last.
              And then, only if you must, then teach.
            </p>

            <h3>Are emojis "language"?</h3>
            <p>
              I would say, <em>yes</em> for people that consistently
              use them with particular meanings. Ad-hoc usage is not.

          <h2>On Writing</h2>
          <p>
	        How is it that we <em>look</em> at a bunch of squiggles
            and start hearing noises in our heads?! <em>Or,</em> am I
            assuming how you think&mdash;is not all reading is
            "verbal"?! Writing is a peculiar thing that
            anybody <em>reading</em> this probably takes for granted.
            How very "meta"&mdash;you are reading about reading!
          </p>
          <p>
            That which we call "writing" is a general skill of
            recognizing and interpretting symbols
            presented <span class="term">graphically</span>&mdash;that
            is a <em>spatial</em> (most often 2D) arrangement of
            some <em>stuff</em> into a discernable form. This can be
            in brush strokes, on a digital display, with braille
            dots...
          </p>
          <p>
            One may also speak of <em>writing</em> as in <em>writing
            music</em>, doing a particular type of shot with
            camera/film, or in the case of the Christian
            tradition&mdash;<span class="term">Iconography</span>. How
            writing is done can vary in quality&mdash;hopefully this
            web page is aesthetically pleasing enough üòÅ
          </p>

          <h3>Linguists on Writing</h3>
          <p>
            A point of dogma for many linguists is that <em>writing
            isn't Language</em> (or some variant of this point). This
            point resonates with many people because of the social
            justice implications of holding this view&mdash;evidently,
            not all people groups have writing systems. So as to not
            say that certain people groups have "more developed"
            language than others, it is necessary to either (1) assert
            that <em>writing isn't language</em> or (2) redefine
            "writing" in such a way that using a writing system is
            nothing special.

          <p>
            Here, we return to a more general field of study than
            "linguistics proper"
            called <span class="term">semiology</span>...
          </p>
 
          <h3>Literate forever</h3>
          <p>
            Writing fundamentally changes how people approach
	        communication. Even if you never touch another book in
	        your life, the idea of "recording speech" is forever in
	        your head. You cannot escape the idea of "alphabetical
	        order".
          </p>
          <p>
            To neglect writing in the study of "language" is like
            trying to study the form of bicycles while ignoring the
            anatomy of human riders and the condition of local roads.
