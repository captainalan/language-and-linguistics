	  <h1>"Language" and Linguistics</h1>
	  <div class="abstract">
	    <p>
	      The term <b>"language"</b> means different things to
	      different people. This seemingly trite observation is
	      often overlooked in discussions of all
	      things <em>language</em>. There are many well-intending
	      people (especially linguists)</a> on quests to correct
	      "misconceptions" about "language" or otherwise spread
	      their views about <em>the true nature</em> of
	      "language". As it turns out, there is little consensus
	      among language researchers at large about what
	      "language" is. Furthermore, when specialists <em>do</em>
	      agree on some definition, it tends to lie far from
	      laypeople's intuitions. For instance, (generative)
	      linguists may talk about "<b>'Language' with a Capital
	      'L'</b>" to distinguish <em>the human capacity to use
	      particular languages</em> from the particulars of
	      "languages" themselves (whatever those are).
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I find it useful to think of "language" as <em>any form
	      of conventionalized communication</em>. Under such a
	      broad definition, "language" include things like
	      gestures and body language, symbols and signs, and other
	      forms of "non-verbal communication". By my very loose
	      definition here, language is not unique to humans and
	      interspecies communication happens between you and your
	      pet dog. Another place my definition of language here
	      leads to is the fact that <em>some languages are more
	      complex than others</em>. While this statement may not
	      seem at-face controversial to the unindoctrinated, it
	      has become a point of pontificating for "social justice"
	      concerned academics tied to various forms
	      of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/">egalitarian</a>
	      ethics.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Steer away from discussions about "language" (or
	      "society", or "the economy") with those who are not
	      willing to define their terms yet maintain strong
	      positions. Observe first, describe next, theorize last.
	      And then, only if you must, then teach.

	  <h2>Written Language</h2>
	  <p>
	    How is it that we <em>look</em> at a bunch of squiggles
	    and start hearing noises in our heads?! (Or, am I assuming
	    how you think; not all reading is verbal now, is it?!)
	  </p>
	  <h3>Linguists on Writing</h3>
	  <p>
	    A point of dogma for many linguists is that <em>writing
	    isn't Language</em> (or some variant of this point). This
	    point resonates with many people because of the social
	    justice implications of holding this view&mdash;evidently,
	    not all people groups have writing systems. So as to not
	    say that certain people groups have "more developed"
	    language than others, it is necessary to either (1) assert
	    that <em>writing isn't language</em> or (2) redefine
	    "writing" in such a way that using a writing system is
	    nothing special.
	  </p>
	  <h4>Literate forever</h4>
	  <p>
	    Writing fundamentally changes how people approach
	    communication. Even if you never touch another book in
	    your life, the idea of "recording speech" is forever in
	    your head. You cannot escape the idea of "alphabetical
	    order".
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    To neglect writing in the study of "language" is like
	    trying to study the form of bicycles while ignoring the
	    anatomy of human riders and the condition of local roads.
