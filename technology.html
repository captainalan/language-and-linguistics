              Face-to-face interactions&mdash;as well as audio/video
              to an extent&mdash;unify the "language interface". It is
              in <span class="term">writing</span> and with different
              scripts that languages can start to really differ
              radically in form! Historically, we can see that the
              form of different scripts is informed by <em>how the
              glyphs of that language were formed</em>. For example,
              in East Asia, we see brush-based scripts. Cuneiform is
              based off wedges being pressed into clay. Europe saw the
              use of quill/feather pens. With computers in the 21st
              century, all this diversity is smashed together into the
              same glowing screen interface...

              The focus of this page is on the language technology of
              writing in the context of <span class="term">Information
              Technology (IT)</span>, including personal computers and
              smartphones.

          <h2>Crafting the Multi-lingual Web</h2>
          <p>
            Whatever technique you are using to produce web content
            (e.g. manually writing HTML as I am here, or using a
            framework like React), you will want to make sure you have
            control over the <code>lang</code> HTML attribute. Learn
            more about this from
            the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang">MDN
            web docs</a>. For example, if you need to use a paragraph
            of Korean in a webpage, you ought to do
            set <code>lang="ko"</code> in your paragraph tag.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setting the <code>lang</code> attribute is better than
            ad-hoc solutions to make a webpage <em>look</em> the right
            way because you are specifying
            the <span class="term">semantics</span> of some content.
            It is not enough to just have some words, we must tell our
            clients' browsers the language we're writing in! This can
            make it more likely that tools like screen readers,
            automatic translation services, and even correct font
            rendering (still a problem often, unfortunately) succeed.

          <h3>Make text big enough to read!</h3>
          <p>
            Some scripts need bigger characters to read than others.
            My eyesight isn't terrible, but I still zoom in to read
            East Asian texts so I don't have to needlessly suffer.
            Using the lang attribute, as described above, you
            can <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_attribute_selectors.asp">make
            certain languages display with larger text!</a>.
            Samples below:
          </p>
          <div style="background-color:#FAFAFA; font-weight:light; border-radius:10px" class="px-3 pt-3 pb-2 mb-3 text-center">
            <p lang="zh-Hant">沒想到，打字比手寫方便多了。</p>
            <p lang="ja">１２５％のサイズで読みやすいですよ。</p>
            <p lang="ko">타자하기는 정말 재미 있어요</p>
            <p lang="es">No es necesario magnificar texto español.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Considering script-particular attributes can differentiate
            your hand-crafted localization work from careless
            automated localization. Additional areas where language
            specific issues may come up include languages read right
            to left (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic), the presence of rare
            characters (writing a page on Egyptian hieroglyphics?) and
            whether or not suitable font faces are available to
            support your site design in all of your target languages.

          <h2>Text Input</h2>
          <p>
            How can a <span class="term">keyboard</span> with a
            hundred or so keys be used to type thousands of different
            Chinese characters? How do I type accent marks correctly
            so I can pass Spanish class? These questions and more will
            be answered on this page.
           </p>

          <h3>Keyboard Basics</h3>
          <p>
            If you (want to) write a lot of another language, you
            should learn a dedicated keyboard layout for multi-lingual
            input. For typing Spanish/French/German/etc. I use the US
            International keyboard. Using a language like Russian or
            Arabic will require learning a new keyboard layout. You
            should learn the standard layouts for these languages
            rather than trying to learn some "phonetic" QWERTY-like
            variant, given the choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chinese, Japanese, and Korean all have complicated scripts
            that must incorporate an additional software level to read
            in keypresses and then <em>compose</em> (in the case of
            Korean) or <em>select</em> (in the case of Chinese and
            Japanese) glyphs. I wrote a descriptive article
            on <a href="./languages/korean/input.html">Korean Input
            Methods</a>, which describes some specifics of typing
            Korean, which makes use of its own non-Latin alphabet.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't have to type <em>that many</em> special
            characters, making use of a <span class="term">compose
            key</span> can be a non-intrusive way to get multilingual
            text powers. On Linux, I map this key to the right Windows
            key on my (full-sized) keyboard.
          </p>

          <h3>Platform Specific Notes</h3>
          <p>
            The more different scripts you make use of, the more
            complicated your setup will necessarily become. If it is
            not too much trouble to do, if is often easier to isolate
            the contexts in which you use particular languages (e.g.
            set up Korean input on one account/computer and do Arabic
            only from your phone). The world can handle bilingualism,
            but jumping between too many languagse will likely have
            you working against your technology.
          </p>

          <h4>Windows</h4>
          <p>
            Windows has pretty good default mutli-lingual support.
            Yet, in many ways it seems to be a mess, reflecting
            different histories of keyboard support with different
            languages.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <h5>Four Different Default Input Method Switching Keys</h5>
            <p>
              These are default keys on MS Windows; for some languages you
              can modify them, for others you can't
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Chinese</b>: Shift key toggles Pinyin/Chinese and underlying QWERTY
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Japanese</b>: without a Japanese keyboard, Alt +
                backtick toggles Japanese input and underlying QWERTY;
                there are ways to toggle Katakana/Hiragana but I don't
                think people do this much&mdash;they justly rely on
                predictive text
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Korean</b> right Alt key is to toggle between
                Korean/QWERTY input. The right Ctrl key does Korean
                hangul to hanja (Chinese character) conversion; this
                is rarely used by most people. Because the right
                modifiers are used for language-related things, doing
                stuff like programing and the like, you have to use
                ctrl + alt on the left hand
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Russian</b> (and other European languages): to
                switch keyboard layouts, you will have to press
                Windows + Space; this is also how you switch between
                Russian and other languages (such as those listed
                above)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>

          <h4>Linux</h4>
          <p>
            Switching between different "underlying" keyboard layouts
            (e.g. English, Russian) can be done using included
            software of most distributions. To enter in complex input
            like Chinese/Japanese/Korean, you'll probably need to make
            use of <code>fcitx</code>, <code>ibus</code> or some other
            software package. I have not had success getthing these
            packages to also work with changing an underlying keyboard
            layout&mdash;everything gets complicated and my computer
            crashes. So, now I only do European languages on Linux.

          <h2>Emacs</h2>
          <p>
            Emacs, which can be installed on all major operating
            systems, provides multilingual input out-of-the-box,
            provided you have the correct fonts installed. This can be
            useful for working with other languages and not changing
            too many configs. Emacs also contains input methods for
            doing things like typing <i>Hànyǔ Pīnyīn</i> (Romanized
            Chinese standard) which is not easily done with default
            OS's multilingual support.
            Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto
            fonts</a> are freely available and work well with pretty
            much any language/script.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>*-prefix</code> input methods are similar to
            using the US international keyboard (with "dead keys").
            Using the
            <code>spanish-prefix</code> method, for instance, I can type
            <code>pi~nata</code> and it will give me 
            <span lang="es"><i>piñata</i></span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Combined with a tool
            like <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>, this is a
            great way to smash out assignments in a foreign language
            with very little config, especially if you're already
            using/familiar with emacs for other things.
