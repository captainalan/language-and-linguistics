              Face-to-face interactions&mdash;as well as audio/video
              to an extent&mdash;unify the "language interface". It is
              in <span class="term">writing</span> and with different
              scripts that languages can start to really differ
              radically in form! Historically, we can see that the
              form of different scripts is informed by <em>how the
              glyphs of that language were formed</em>. For example,
              in East Asia, we see brush-based scripts. Cuneiform is
              based off wedges being pressed into clay. Europe saw the
              use of quill/feather pens. With computers in the 21st
              century, all this diversity is smashed together into the
              same glowing screen interface...

              Technology (IT)</span>, including personal computers and
              smartphones.

          <h2>Keyboarding</h2>
          <p>
            How can a keyboard with a hundred or so keys be used to
            type thousands of different Chinese characters? How do I
            type accent marks correctly so I can pass Spanish class?
            These questions and more will be answered on this page.
           </p>

          <h3 id="Western">Western Scripts</h3>
          <p>
            If you (want to) write a lot of another language, you
            should learn a dedicated keyboard layout for multi-lingual
            input. For typing Spanish/French/German/etc. I use the US
            International keyboard. Using a language like Russian or
            Arabic will require learning a new keyboard layout. You
            should learn the standard layouts for these languages
            rather than trying to learn some "phonetic" QWERTY-like
            variant, given the choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't have to type <em>that many</em> special
            characters, making use of a <span class="term">compose
            key</span> can be a non-intrusive way to get multilingual
            text powers. On Linux, I map this key to the right Windows
            key on my (full-sized) keyboard.
          </p>


          <h3 id="CJK">Chinese, Japanese, Korean</h3>
          <p>
            Chinese, Japanese, and Korean all have complicated scripts
            that must incorporate an additional software level to read
            in keypresses and then <em>compose</em> (in the case of
            Korean) or <em>select</em> (in the case of Chinese and
            Japanese) glyphs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote a descriptive article
            on <a href="./languages/korean/input.html">Korean Input
            Methods</a>
          </p>

          <h3>Platform Specific Tools</h3>
          <p>
            The more different scripts you make use of, the more
            complicated your setup will necessarily become.
          </p>

          <h4>Windows</h4>
          <p>
            Windows has pretty good default mutli-lingual support.
            Yet, in many ways it seems to be a mess, reflecting
            different histories of keyboard support with different
            languages.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <h5>Four Different Default Input Method Switching Keys</h5>
            <p>
              These are default keys on MS Windows; for some languages you
              can modify them, for others you can't
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Chinese</b>: Shift key toggles Pinyin/Chinese and underlying QWERTY
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Japanese</b>: without a Japanese keyboard, Alt +
                backtick toggles Japanese input and underlying QWERTY;
                there are ways to toggle Katakana/Hiragana but I don't
                think people do this much&mdash;they justly rely on
                predictive text
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Korean</b> right Alt key is to toggle between
                Korean/QWERTY input. The right Ctrl key does Korean
                hangul to hanja (Chinese character) conversion; this
                is rarely used by most people. Because the right
                modifiers are used for language-related things, doing
                stuff like programing and the like, you have to use
                ctrl + alt on the left hand
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Russian</b> (and other European languages): to
                switch keyboard layouts, you will have to press
                Windows + Space; this is also how you switch between
                Russian and other languages (such as those listed
                above)
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h4>Linux</h4>
          <p style="text-decoration:line-through;">
            Recently my setup is to use <code>fcitx</code> with Sun
            Pinyin for Chinese and Mozc for Japanese. My setup is only
            90% working on Linux; there are lots of things that can
            get confusing when you pile a whole bunch of layers of
            (software) abstraction on top of each other especially if
            you try to do stuff like rebind other keys on your
            computer or use specialized peripherals (e.g. keyboard,
            mouse).
          </p>
          <p>
            Update 07/03/2020&mdash;currently I'm doing my
            Chinese/Japanese/Korean stuff on Windows and European
            languages on Linux.

        <div class="col-md-4 mt-5" id="EmacsBox"> 
          <h2>Emacs</h2>
          <p>
            Emacs, which can be installed on all major operating
            systems, provides multilingual input out-of-the-box,
            provided you have the correct fonts installed. This can be
            useful for working with other languages and not changing
            too many configs. Emacs also contains input methods for
            doing things like typing <i>HÃ nyÇ” PÄ«nyÄ«n</i> (Romanized
            Chinese standard) which is not easily done with default
            OS's multilingual support.
            Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto
            fonts</a> are freely available and work well with pretty
            much any language/script.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>*-prefix</code> input methods are similar to
            using the US international keyboard (with "dead keys").
            Using the
            <code>spanish-prefix</code> method, for instance, I can type
            <code>pi~nata</code> and it will give me 
            <span lang="es"><i>piÃ±ata</i></span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Combined with a tool
            like <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>, this is a
            great way to smash out assignments in a foreign language
            with very little config, especially if you're already
            using/familiar with emacs for other things.
