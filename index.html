          <h2>How to enjoy studying foreign languages and be normal</h2>
          <p>
            I wrote this short essay/reflection on on June 3, 2022. I hope you find these words to be helpful.

            <li>
              <b>Sounds/forms are very important.</b> Learning the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) as well as how to properly pronounce languages you are interested in (e.g. Mandarin Chinese if you have to work with Chinese people) is nearly always profitable. Taking the time/care to properly say names shows you are willing to go a step further than most opinion-broadcasters to respect someone of another language/culture/etc. Learning the basics of reading/writing can allow you to quickly learn new words via making use of lexical resources like dictionaries, websites, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Don't be antisocial or a weirdo. </b>  If you are going to learn just one second language, pick on that is practical for what you do. For instance, if you know many French speakers in your area and you only speak English, go ahead and learn French to better connect with those around you. Choosing a more common "world language" is usually a safe bet if you don't know what to do. However, if you know you'll be living in another country, interacting with a lot of people of a certain ethnicity (e.g. Greeks in Orthodox Church), and so on, then you may opt to focus your efforts on a language that isn't as popular by numbers, but which you will frequently encounter as you try to do a better job at what you already do. If it is natural/normal for you to use another language (no explanation needed) this is better. Contrast this with my errors---learning East Asian languages in the USA has been hard for me because I have failed to integrate into any non-English speaking East Asian groups over the long run...
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Sell/volunteer your time and effort to help you learn.</b> Rather than being a fed in an underground facility listening to audio recordings, why not do some work in a place where you can hear your target language? e.g. if you're trying to learn Vietnamese and you need some extra money, you could work at a local Vietnamese super market. Learn something useful to other people.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Find profitable routines and keep doing them.</b> Find actions you can take again and again that bring you gains in your language learning.. For instance, if reading some of a newsletter in another language helps you study grammar/vocabulary as well as keep up with a local community, this is a useful to keep up. If listening to some program during your commute works well, keep doing that. Don't be stuck asking "what should I do to make progress on XYZ". Instead, know what to do and be intentional..
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Make friends.</b> While I do think lots of study has to be done alone outside of formal educational settings, having people to share insights with, ask opinions about things on, and so on is very helpful for keeping things moving. Furthermore, the best friends are made when engaged in a common struggle. The previous point can be applied to foreign language learners working together. OR, it can mean working with people doing something in common (like some job) and needing to use a target foreign language to achieve some goal.
