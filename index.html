	  <h1>Language and Linguistics</h1>
	  <div class="abstract">
	    <p>
	      The term <b>"language"</b> means different things to
	      different people. This is an important point to make
	      because there are many well-intending people out there
	      (especially linguists)</a> on quests to correct
	      "misconceptions" about language or otherwise spread
	      their views about <em>the true nature</em> of
	      "language". As it turns out, there is little consensus
	      among language researchers at large about what
	      "language" is. Furthermore, when specialists <em>do</em>
	      agree on some definition, it tends to lie far from
	      laypeople's intuitions. For instance, (generative)
	      linguists may talk about "<b>'Language' with a Capital
	      'L'</b>" to distinguish <em>the human capacity to use
	      particular languages</em> from the particulars of
	      "languages" themselves (whatever those are).
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Now, I like to think of language as <em>any form of
	      conventionalized communication</em>. Under such a broad
	      definition, "language" include things like gestures and
	      body language, symbols and signs, and other forms of
	      "non-verbal communication". By my very loose definition
	      here, language is not unique to humans and interspecies
	      communication happens between you and your pet
	      dog. Another place my definition of language here leads
	      to is the fact that <em>some languages are more complex
	      than others</em>. While this statement may not seem
	      at-face controversial to the unindoctrinated, it has
	      become a point of pontificating for "social justice"
	      concerned academics tied to various forms
	      of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/">egalitarian</a>
	      ethics.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      In my opinion, better than quibbling about what terms
	      like "language" mean is to appreciate the different ways
	      people use these terms and to focus your energies
	      learning (by using!) the languages you find most
	      interesting.

	  <h2 id="LanguageLearning">Language Learning</h2>
	  <p>
	    Below are some tips/hints on language learning I've
	    developed over the last decade or so.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Good ideas</h3>
	  <p>
	    In general, I think <b>"Immersion" approaches</b> to
	    language learning are best. This doesn't mean you have to
	    pretend to be a four year old (you can never go back
	    there), but rather to <em>always expose yourself to
	    language in the context of meaning</em>. Don't just try to
	    "study" some words, <em>find uses for those words</em> and
	    <em>observe how skilled speakers use them</em>. This could
	    mean lots of things: cooking with your grandmother,
	    watching videos on the Internet, loitering in a supermarket...
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I find it productive to <b>accept the authority of "native
	    speakers"</b> on the language(s) they speak. Your goal is
	    to successfully reproduce certain patterns, so don't argue
	    with people that can do what you can't. Instead, try to
	    see how they are right ("in their own way"), even if what
	    they are saying goes against your other learning. This may
	    be difficult for linguists who have learned to hate
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription">prescriptive
	    grammar</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Above all, <b>keep motivation high</b>, which often means
	    listening to boredom and avoiding complicated
	    explanations. Classrooms are infamous for making fun
	    things boring; get out of the classroom if that is how you
	    find your funzies.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Been there, done that</h3>
	  <p>
	    For a long while, I used <b>Spaced Repetition Systems</b>
	    ("digital flashcards"). Eventually I stopped. While I
	    think it is possible to use these systems effectively,
	    paired with other materials, a language partner, etc. I
	    think that they are not sufficient as a <em>main</em>
	    study method because they present you with lots of "data"
	    without context. While it is possible to add images,
	    sentences, etc. to digital flashcards, at a certian point
	    doing this becomes more of a pain in the ass than a help.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Language Learners in Society</h3>
	  <p>
	    If you are not a child or a very attractive person
	    (e.g. one who possesses great beauty, wealth, etc.), you
	    may find language learning difficult. It is time to be
	    humble. Most people won't have an automatically given
	    reason to talk to you, so it is your job to make yourself
	    worth time and attention. Can you be a much better than
	    average listener? Will you do some manual labor (e.g. hang
	    out and rake some leaves, wash dishes)? What are you
	    willing to do to earn the opportunity to siphon some
	    language knowledge?
	  </p>

	  <h2 id="WritingSystems">Writing Systems</h2>
	  <p>
	    How is it that we <em>look</em> at a bunch of squiggles
	    and start hearing noises in our heads?! (Or, am I assuming
	    how you think; not all reading is verbal now, is it?!)
	  </p>
	  <h3>Linguists on Writing</h3>
	  <p>
	    A point of dogma for many linguists is that <em>writing
	    isn't Language</em> (or some variant of this point). This
	    point resonates with many people because of the social
	    justice implications of holding this view&mdash;evidently,
	    not all people groups have writing systems. So as to not
	    say that certain people groups have "more developed"
	    language than others, it is necessary to either (1) assert
	    that <em>writing isn't language</em> or (2) redefine
	    "writing" in such a way that using a writing system is
	    nothing special.
	  </p>
	  <h4>Literate forever</h4>
	  <p>
	    Writing fundamentally changes how people approach
	    communication. Even if you never touch another book in
	    your life, the idea of "recording speech" is forever in
	    your head. You cannot escape the idea of "alphabetical
	    order".
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    To neglect writing in the study of "language" is like
	    trying to study the form of bicycles while ignoring the
	    anatomy of human riders and the condition of local roads.

	  <h2>Links & Resources</h2>

	  <p>Gathered here are links to freely available tools and
	  resources which I have found useful.</p>

	  <h3>References</h3>
	  <p>
	    For <b>language learning</b> the most important thing I
	    look for in a dictionary is <em>lots of example
	    sentences</em>. Often better than any explanation of how
	    some grammar thing works is the form in question <em>in
	    actual use</em>. Many freely accessible (as in beer, not
	    freedom) websites provide useful dictionaries in many
	    languages. For instance, I often
	    use <a href="https://endic.naver.com/?sLn=en">Naver's
	    dictionaries</a>, which are available for English, Korean,
	    Chinese, Japanese...
	  </p>
	  <hr>

	  <h3>Tools</h3>
	  <p>
	    Here, I extol tools that are useful for doing
	    language-related things including (1) creating
	    multilingual documents, (2) entering non-ASCII characters,
	    and (3) getting organized for productive study,
	    note-taking, etc.
	  </p>

	  <h4>Emacs for Linguistic Computing</h4>
	  <p>
	    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a>
	    does so many things. In addition to being a text editor (→
	    the tool you use to write <code>computer programs</code>) it makes an
	    excellent...
	    <ul>
	      <li>File manager
	      (via <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredMode">Dired</a>)
	      to do common tasks like copying, moving, deleting,
	      files</li>
	      <li>Organizer for productivity with <a href="https://orgmode.org">Org mode</a> (and
	      something like
	      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting
	      Things Done</a> methodology)</li>
	      <li>Desktop <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2009/06/23/">Calculator</a></li>
	      <li>Word Processor (with <a href="https://piotr.is/2010/emacs-as-the-ultimate-latex-editor/">LaTeX</a>)</li>
	      <li><a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">RSS Reader</a></li>
	      <li>Method for typing funny characters (e.g. <i>Nǐ huì
	      shuō Zhōngwén
	      ma? <a href="http://pinyin.info/">Pīnyīn</a>
	      hǎo.</i>)</li>
	      <li>Endless amusement + entertainment 😎</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Perhaps my favorite part about emacs is that it allows me
	    to be both very productive and "machine agnostic". Emacs
	    runs nicely on Linux, Windows, MacOS, etc.
	  </p>

	  <h4>Document Processing</h4>
	  <p>
	    <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>, "a universal
	  document converter", is a very useful tool for dealing with
	  documents (and people) of all sorts. It has built in Unicode
	    (→ multilingual) support.

	    People that think about computers, society, <em>and</em>
	    language (and produce lots of content).
