		Russian is a language of fantastic literature, music,
		and more. Unlike the other European languages with
		funny accent marks, its default <b>keyboard layout</b> is pretty
		decent (see
		a <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/russian_keyboard_layout.html">heatmap
		of the standard layout</a>). As with the Western
		European languages, the art of <b>typography</b> is
		quite developed for the Cyrllic script (used with
		Russian, Mongolian, and other
		languages&mdash;see <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?subset=cyrillic">Google
		fonts</a> for some cool examples).

	  <h2>Interest/Motivation</h2>
	  <p>
	    What is interesting about Russian to me?
	  </p>
	  <h3>A Non-Western Internet</h3>
	  <p>
	    Along with Chinese, Russian is a major Internet language.
	    European languages like French, German, and Spanish are
	    used on many of the same websites that English is used on.
	    Russia, like China, has held hostile positions towards
	    "the West" and has developed its own Interwebs.
	  </p>
	  <blockquote class="blockquote">
	    Since 1995, Russians have consistently held positive views
	    of China. As of September 2018, 75% of Russians view China
	    favorably, with only 13% expressing a negative
	    opinion. According to a 2019 survey by the Pew Research
	    Center, 71% of Russians have a favorable view of China,
	    with 18% expressing an unfavorable view.  Similarly, a
	    YouGov survey found that 71% of the Chinese think Russia
	    has a positive effect on world affairs, while 15% view it
	    negatively.

	    I'm curious to see how the Russian internet compares to
	    the Western and Chinese internets.

	  <h3>The Eurasian Landmass</h3>
	  <p>
	    Geographically, Russia sits above China, and has
	    historically had contact (including much conflict) with
	    the nations of East Asia.

	  <h3>Research</h3>
	  <p>
	    Russians have done a lot of linguistics and philology (see
	    Wikipedia's list
	    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_linguists_and_philologists">Russian
	    Linguists and Philologists</a>. Much Russian language research remains untranslated.

	  <h2>Learning Notes</h2>
	  <p>
	    Here I share some of my thoughts about learning
	    Russian.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Easy Stuff</h3>
	  <p>
	    Overall, the Cyrillic alphabet is really nice. Typing is
	    much like in English&mdash;one keystroke gives you one
	    letter. This is much nicer than doing all the finger
	    gymnastics needed for typing languages like German or
	    Spanish.  If you've attempted Chinese, Japanese, Korean
	    you will know the pain
	    of <a href="../chinese/characters.html">Chinese
	    Characters</a>. None of that silliness with Russian. You
	    can easily look up words by how they are spelled
	  </p>

	  <h3>Hard Stuff</h3>
	  <p>
	    You must
	    memorize <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)#Lexical_stress>">lexical
	    stress</a></b>. Note that you have to do this more many
	    languages, including English and German. It is kinda like
	    memorizing tone for Chinese, except you only have to
	    remember one thing (whereas for tone you'd have to
	    remember the tone for every syllable of a word).

	  <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Tech Stuff</h2>
	  <p>
	    Support for Cyrillic has been with computers for a long
	    time. If you use emacs, you can <code>M-x
	    set-input-method</code> to start typing in Russian with
	    zero config!
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    One advantage of using Russian over other European
	    languages is that you can use your same US keyboard with
	    all features intact (other Euro keyboards typically shrink
	    the left shift button to make room for another key).
