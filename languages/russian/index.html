	  <h1>Russian</h1>
	  <p>
	    Russian is a language of fantastic literature, music, and
	    more. Its default keyboard is pretty decent (see a <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/russian_keyboard_layout.html">heatmap
	    of the standard layout</a>).
	  </p>
	  <h2>Interest/Motivation</h2>
	  <p>
	    What is interesting about Russian to me?
	  </p>
	  <h3>A Non-Western Internet</h3>
	  <p>
	    Along with Chinese, Russian is a major Internet language.
	    European languages like French, German, and Spanish are
	    used on many of the same websites that English is used on.
	    Russia, like China, has held hostile positions towards
	    "the West" and has developed its own Interwebs.
	  </p>
	  <blockquote class="blockquote">
	    Since 1995, Russians have consistently held positive views
	    of China. As of September 2018, 75% of Russians view China
	    favorably, with only 13% expressing a negative
	    opinion. According to a 2019 survey by the Pew Research
	    Center, 71% of Russians have a favorable view of China,
	    with 18% expressing an unfavorable view.  Similarly, a
	    YouGov survey found that 71% of the Chinese think Russia
	    has a positive effect on world affairs, while 15% view it
	    negatively.

	  <p>
	    I'm curious to see how the Russian internet compares to
	    the Western and Chinese internets.

	  <h3>The Eurasian Landmass</h3>
	  <p>
	    Geographically, Russia sits above China, and has
	    historically had contact (including much conflict) with
	    the nations of East Asia.

	  <p>(Test text)</p>
	  <h3>Research</h3>
	  <p>
	    Russians have done a lot of linguistics and philology (see
	    Wikipedia's list
	    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_linguists_and_philologists">Russian
	    Linguists and Philologists</a>. Much Russian language research remains untranslated.
