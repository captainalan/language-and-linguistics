                <h1>A Description of Russian</h1>
                <p class="px-4">
                    Russian is a language of fantastic literature, music, and
                    more. Furthermore, it a language of great utility for
                    studying just what has happened in much of the world
                    during the past couple hundred years. Many Russian
                    language sources remain untranslated into English (and
                    other world languages). Russian has a long written history
                    and there many other related languages you can study (e.g.
                    Slavonic) which will be easier with a command of Russian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Russian uses the Cyrillic script. As with the Western
                    European languages, the art of typography is quite
                    developed for the Cyrllic script (used with Russian,
                    Mongolian, and other languages. As such, you can enjoy
                    beautiful texts, carefully typeset (c.f. Chinese language
                    websites you have to zoom in to view, only a handful of
                    font choices). Unlike the other European languages with
                    funny accent marks, its default keyboard layout is pretty
                    decent (see
                    a <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/russian_keyboard_layout.html">heatmap
                        of the standard layout</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I very much like the sound of the Russian language. One
                    special feature of Russian is that there is a lot
                    of <b>palatalization</b>, which manifests as <i>y</i>
                    sounds everywhere&mdash;that combined with many "reduced
                    vowels" (more on this below) make Russian a very
                    "smooth" sounding language. For me this was lots of fun
                    because the languages I have the most experience
                    studying (East Asian languages, Spanish) are rather
                    choppy languages with relatively simple syllable
                    structure.
