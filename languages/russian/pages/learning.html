                    To get used to hearing and producing the sounds of Russian,
                    I suggest going through some videos on YouTube (Yandex, etc).
                    Once you have a basic grasp of that and know some words/phrases,
                    you can begin building your grammatical knowledge and vocabulary.

                <p>
                    I'm using a number of paper resources&mdash;I'll be updating 
                    my <a href="bookshelf.html">bookshelf page</a> to list these.
                    Paper resources are especially helpful for studying Russian
                    because they can be expected to be nicely typeset with accent
                    marks for learners marked.
                </p>
                <h3>Online Resources</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm making use of the following online resources:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://translate.yandex.com">Yandex
                            Translate</a>&mdash; this high tech translation service
                        offers useful example suggestions and example sentences as
                        you look stuff up. You can also make this read sentences
                        for you too.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://en.openrussian.org">OpenRussian.org</a>&mdash;
                        Dictionary with many example sentences
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.wordreference.com/">WordReference</a> Russian to
                        English Dictionary&mdash;has grammatical information that "big data"
                        type dictionaries might lack
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://masterrussian.com/">Master Russian</a>&mdash;many
                        useful pages on Russian grammar, culture, and more
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Every dictionary/resource will have its own conventions for
                    expressing stuff like case declension patterns nouns follow.
                    Therefore, it is better to get well-versed with a couple of
                    resources rather than jumping around and Googling stuff so
                    that you can systematically build up a mental model of how
                    this language is put together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I've been making use of
                    <a href="https://www.wiktionary.org/">Wiktionary</a> for
                    learning interesting etymological information about words
                    I'm curious about.

                <h2>Impressions</h2>
                <p>
                    Here are some practical observations and notes on what I've
                    been doing with Russian.
                </p>

                <h3>Easy Stuff</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall, the Cyrillic alphabet is really nice. Typing is
                    much like in English&mdash;one keystroke gives you one
                    letter. This is much nicer than doing all the finger
                    gymnastics needed for typing languages like German or
                    Spanish. If you've attempted Chinese, Japanese, Korean
                    you will know the pain
                    of <a href="../chinese/characters.html">Chinese
                        Characters</a>. None of that silliness with Russian. You
                    can easily look up words by how they are spelled
                </p>
                <p>
                    Russian is a relatively homogenous language because of
                    top-down planning by the Soviets, among other things.
                    If you have some grammar question and know the
                    proper terms to look up, you'll be able to find your
                    answers in existing resources.
                </p>

                <h3>Hard Stuff</h3>
                <p>
                    You must
                    memorize <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)#Lexical_stress>">lexical
                            stress</a></b>. Note that you have to do this more many
                    languages, including English and German. It is kinda like
                    memorizing tone for Chinese, except you only have to
                    remember one thing (whereas for tone you'd have to
                    remember the tone for every syllable of a word).
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Cyrllic is not so bad to learn, you will have to
                    deal with some (1) spelling-pronunciation mismatches (e.g.
                    the genitive masculine singular adjective 
                    ending <span lang="ru">-ого</span>) and (2) some script
                    variants&mdash;e.g. italic letter forms are different, you
                    may have to read handwriting, you may encounter some now
                    archaic letters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Russian pronunciation is tough to get the hang of. There
                    are many sounds in Russian that are not in other languages
                    (linguists would call these sounds "<b>marked</b>").
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of "grammar" to memorize in the sense that you
                    will need to learn many different forms for nouns (declensions)
                    and verbs (conjugations).
