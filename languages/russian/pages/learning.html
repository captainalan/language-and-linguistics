                    By <a href="https://captainalan.github.io">Alan W</a> &mdash;
                    Last updated September 24, 2020
                  </div>
                <p>
                    Here are some practical observations and notes on what I've
                    been doing with Russian.
                </p>

                <h3>Easy Stuff</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall, the Cyrillic alphabet is really nice. Typing is
                    much like in English&mdash;one keystroke gives you one
                    letter. This is much nicer than doing all the finger
                    gymnastics needed for typing languages like German or
                    Spanish. If you've attempted Chinese, Japanese, Korean
                    you will know the pain
                    of <a href="../chinese/characters.html">Chinese
                        Characters</a>. None of that silliness with Russian. You
                    can easily look up words by how they are spelled
                </p>
                <p>
                    Russian is a relatively homogenous language because of
                    top-down planning by the Soviets, among other things.
                </p>

                <h3>Hard Stuff</h3>
                <p>
                    You must
                    memorize <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)#Lexical_stress>">lexical
                            stress</a></b>. Note that you have to do this more many
                    languages, including English and German. It is kinda like
                    memorizing tone for Chinese, except you only have to
                    remember one thing (whereas for tone you'd have to
                    remember the tone for every syllable of a word).
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Cyrllic is not so bad to learn, you will have to
                    deal with some (1) spelling-pronunciation mismatches (TODO
                    give examples) and (2) some script
                    variants&mdash;e.g. italic letter forms are different, you
                    may have to read handwriting, you may encounter some now
                    archaic letters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Russian pronunciation is tough to get the hang of. There
                    are many sounds in Russian that are not in other languages
                    (linguists would call these sounds "<b>marked</b>").
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Study Materials</h2>
                <p>
                    I have been leveraging the <b>barbell strategy</b> (using
                    two, very unlike approaches; see N.N. Taleb) to study
                    Russian. I'm using traditional paper books (<i>Russian
                        Course: A Complete Course for Beginners</i> (Brown
                    1996), <i>Russian Practical Dictionary</i> (Yermolovich
                    2011)) and online resources. Hearing actual speakers say and
                    use words is invaluable. A quick video search for something
                    like "Russian words" will yield ample videos of native
                    speakers reading Russian words with the words displayed so
                    you can see how spelling and pronunciation are mapped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm making use of the following online resources:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://translate.yandex.com">Yandex
                            Translate</a>&mdash; this high tech translation service
                        offers useful example suggestions and example sentences as
                        you look stuff up. You can also make this read sentences
                        for you too.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.wordreference.com/">WordReference</a> Russian to
                        English Dictionary&mdash;if you study other languages, I'd suggest
                        choosing a browser (e.g. Firefox, Brave) to dedicate to each language.
                        This way sites like word reference can remember which dictionaries you
                        use and you won't have to select your correct pair from WR's nice
                        collection.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Every dictionary/resource will have its own conventions for
                    expressing stuff like case declension patterns nouns follow.
                    Therefore, it is better to get well-versed with a couple of
                    resources rather than jumping around and Googling stuff so
                    that you can systematically build up a mental model of how
                    this language is put together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I've been making use of Wiktionary for
                    learning interesting etymological information about words
                    I'm curious about.
                </p>
