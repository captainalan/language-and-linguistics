                <p>
                    What is interesting about Russian to me?
                </p>
                <h3>Orthodox Christianity</h3>
                <p>
                    Many writings have now been translated, but experiencing
                    content in its original language is cool.
                </p>
                <h3>A Non-Western Internet</h3>
                <p>
                    Along with Chinese, Russian is a major Internet language.
                    European languages like French, German, and Spanish are
                    used on many of the same websites that English is used on.
                    Russia, like China, has held hostile positions towards
                    "the West" and has developed its own Interwebs.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    Since 1995, Russians have consistently held positive views
                    of China. As of September 2018, 75% of Russians view China
                    favorably, with only 13% expressing a negative
                    opinion. According to a 2019 survey by the Pew Research
                    Center, 71% of Russians have a favorable view of China,
                    with 18% expressing an unfavorable view. Similarly, a
                    YouGov survey found that 71% of the Chinese think Russia
                    has a positive effect on world affairs, while 15% view it
                    negatively.

                <p>
                    I'm curious to see how the Russian internet compares to
                    the Western and Chinese internets.
                </p>


                <h3>The Eurasian Landmass</h3>
                <p>
                    Geographically, Russia sits above China, and has
                    historically had contact (including much conflict) with
                    the nations of East Asia.
                </p>

                        class="img-fluid mb-4"
                        src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Mere_stone_between_China_and_Russia_-_panoramio.jpg/1920px-Mere_stone_between_China_and_Russia_-_panoramio.jpg"
                        alt="Chinese-Russian Border"></a>

                <h3>The "Dark Side"</h3>
                <p>
                    Russian often gets a bad reputation in the United States
                    (e.g. "Russian collusion"; in contrast, have you heard about
                    "Japanese collusion"?!). One of the reasons I'm motivated to
                    study Russian is that many people I tend to disagree with on
                    matters of opinion often have an... instinctive dislike for
                    Russian.
                </p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                    Russians have done a lot of linguistics and philology (see
                    Wikipedia's list
                    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_linguists_and_philologists">Russian
                        Linguists and Philologists</a>. Much Russian language research remains untranslated.
