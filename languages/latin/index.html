              If one is to study standard languages, one ought to at
              least get some exposure to Latin&mdash;the first and
              perhaps the greatest standard language available to
              learn today. Latin lives not only through the Romance
              languages and the vocabulary of English and other
              languages but through many surviving texts available
              freely on the the Internet.

            <h2>Why Latin?</h2>
            <p>
              See Luke Smith's
              video <a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/videos/watch/b3238d2c-8c19-4d3c-87e6-9415a45619c8">"WHY
              IS LATIN WORTH LEARNING AND USING"</a> (March 2019). To
              learn Latin is to learn how to study grammar and think
              through how propositions are put together. Learning
              Latin is learning the language that has informed much of
              Western thinking&mdash;including how the vernacular
              languages were standardized through grammars and
              dictionaries.

              Latin is a primarily written language. The "modern"
              Latin to learn for me will mainly be Spanish with some
              French and Italian. I have no pressing need to be a nerd
              and speek in Latin.

            <h2>Learning Strategy</h2>
            <p>
              I'm using <i>Wheelock's Latin</i> (7 ed.) as a kind of
              Grammar outline/reference. I will memorize the
              declension paradigms, conjugation tables, and other
              systematic aspects of Latin using the charts in
              the <i>Pocket Oxford Latin Dictionary</i>. While doing
              that (will take some time to memorize everything), I'll
              quickly go through <i>Wheelock's</i> to get a sense of
              which syntactic structures are available. With a grasp
              of (1) what the forms of Latin are (from memorizing the
              tables) and (2) how the language is put together (from a
              cursory overview of a grammar book) I'll then be able to
              start reading extensively to acquire a working knowledge
              of the language.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have three books to read and then there of course are
              many materials online to read. First, I'm going to work
              through the New Testament of the Latin
              Vulgate&mdash;I'll have to do some more research but the
              goal is that I get some of the advantages of reading the
              (source) Greek texts (e.g. preserved word orderings)
              using a language/vocabulary that is more familiar to me.
              I then have the two volumes of <i>Lingua Latina Per Se
              Illustrata</i> (Hans H. Ørberg) to learn some things
              about life in ancient Rome.
            </p>

            <h2>Grammar and Software</h2>
            <p>
              Learning Latin means memorizing a whole lot of details.
              Fortunately, these details are fairly well laid out in
              tables, books, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Latin lends itself well to automated stuff&mdash;I will
              be sharing tools I create here.
