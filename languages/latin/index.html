          If one is to study standard languages, one ought to at
          least get some exposure to Latin&mdash;perhaps
          the greatest <b>standard language</b> available to
          learn today. Latin lives not only through the Romance
          languages and the vocabulary of English and other
          languages but through many surviving texts available
          freely on the the Internet.

        <h2>Why Latin?</h2>
        <p>
          Latin exerts a strong influence over all of the modern European
          languages. It offers a window into the past&mdash;through reading
          Latin, you can read the words of people that lived hundreds of years
          ago. Latin is also a vehicle by which you can learn more about
          the languages you already speak&mdash;where do the words of English
          come from? How have their usages/meanings changed? Studying Latin
          is a useful way to become conscious of how we (modern people) can
          easily fall into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation#:~:text=In%20logic%2C%20equivocation%20('calling,multiple%20senses%20within%20an%20argument.">equivocation</a>
          (or <b>Word&ndash;Concept Fallacy</b>). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly everyone has to learn Latin as a second language. So,
          learning Latin can be a vehicle for meeting people around the world
          who are interested in history, understanding different worldviews,
          and more.

          See Luke Smith's
          video <a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/videos/watch/b3238d2c-8c19-4d3c-87e6-9415a45619c8">"WHY
            IS LATIN WORTH LEARNING AND USING"</a> (March 2019). To
          learn Latin is to learn how to study grammar and think
          through how propositions are put together. Learning
          Latin is learning the language that has informed much of
          Western thinking&mdash;including how the vernacular
          languages were standardized through grammars and
          dictionaries.

          Latin is a primarily written language. One research question I
          have yet to look into is to what extent Latin as a standard
          language has coexisted with the various contemporary Romance
          languages in their earlier forms. Than is&mdash;rather than
          having the Romance languages <em>evolve</em> form Latin, is the
          picture we see more of a <em>standard</em> around which people
          could gravitate with various spoken languages? (linguists might
          call this a kind of <em>diglossia</em>).

        <h2>Learning Latin</h2>
        <p>
          See my page on <a href="pages/learning.html">learning Latin</a> for
          an overview of methods and techniques others have used to successfully
          learn Latin.
        </p>

        <h2>Grammar and Software</h2>
        <p>
          Learning Latin means memorizing a whole lot of details.
          Fortunately, these details are fairly well laid out in
          tables, books, etc. The pages below should be sufficient to
          work through building a basic command of (correct) Latin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its well-defined grammar lends Latin well to automated stuff&mdash;the
          pages I've created below use web technologies to offer features not
          available in traditional paper books.
        </p>

          Each page is designed to be a digestible lesson you can study in one session.
          Whether at home or on the go, you can use these webpages to boost your Latin
          abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is that by working through all the lessons here, you will
          acquire a solid grasp of the "nuts and bolts" of Latin grammar and will be
          well-prepared to study more specific texts and topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          These pages are designed to be compatible with learning through the
          <a href="http://wcdrutgers.net/Latin.htm">Dowling Method</a>.
          They're mobile friendly, so if you're just waiting somewhere and have a
          phone, you can work on memorizing essential Latin forms.
          The idea is after you memorize all the content presented here,
          you should be able to pick up a Latin reader or a text with a parallel
          translation in a language you know
          (e.g. the Latin <a href="https://vulgate.org/">Vulgate</a>) and be able
          to read and boost your vocabulary and working language ability having
          already memorized all the essential "pieces" of Latin.
