          If one is to study standard languages, one ought to at
          least get some exposure to Latin&mdash;
          perhaps the greatest <b>standard language</b> available to
          learn today. Latin lives not only through the Romance
          languages and the vocabulary of English and other
          languages but through many surviving texts available
          freely on the the Internet.

        <h2>Why Latin?</h2>
        <p>
          Latin exerts a strong influence over all of the modern European
          languages. It offers a window into the past&mdash;through reading
          Latin, you can read the words of people that lived hundreds of years
          ago. Nearly everyone has to learn Latin as a second language. So,
          learning Latin can be a vehicle for meeting people around the world
          who are interested in history, understanding different worldviews,
          and more.

          See Luke Smith's
          video <a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/videos/watch/b3238d2c-8c19-4d3c-87e6-9415a45619c8">"WHY
            IS LATIN WORTH LEARNING AND USING"</a> (March 2019). To
          learn Latin is to learn how to study grammar and think
          through how propositions are put together. Learning
          Latin is learning the language that has informed much of
          Western thinking&mdash;including how the vernacular
          languages were standardized through grammars and
          dictionaries.

        <p>
          Latin is a primarily written language. One research question I
          have yet to look into is to what extent Latin as a standard
          language has coexisted with the various contemporary Romance
          languages in their earlier forms. Than is&mdash;rather than
          having the Romance languages <em>evolve</em> form Latin, is the
          picture we see more of a <em>standard</em> around which people
          could gravitate with various spoken languages? (linguists might
          call this a kind of <em>diglossia</em>).

        <h2>Learning Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          See first
          <a href="http://wcdrutgers.net/Latin.htm">Latin by the
            Dowling Method</a>. There are many people who have successfully
          employed this method or variations thereof. Learning Latin, I am
          <i>not going to shy away from "rote memorization"</i>. Indeed,
          at the end of the day, this is the method I had to use to learn
          many Chinese characters/<i>Kanji</i>. Strong foundations in the
          basic forms of a language make learning after that much quicker.
          If it seems too "stupid" of a method, consider how doing pushups
          doesn't really "get anything done" in the world. But by doing
          this type of motion, you can build strength for heavier lifting
          later.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm using <i>Wheelock's Latin</i> (7 ed.) as a kind of
          Grammar outline/reference. I bought this book early on, and
          wouldn't necessarily suggest it as a starting place, but it
          does have correct Latin sentences and in that way
          it is useful. Better, are more concise, well organized resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will memorize the
          declension paradigms, conjugation tables, and other
          systematic aspects of Latin using the charts in
          the <i>Pocket Oxford Latin Dictionary</i>. While doing
          that (will take some time to memorize everything), I'll
          quickly go through <i>Wheelock's</i> to get a sense of
          which syntactic structures are available. With a grasp
          of (1) what the forms of Latin are (from memorizing the
          tables) and (2) how the language is put together (from a
          cursory overview of a grammar book) I'll then be able to
          start reading extensively to acquire a working knowledge
          of the language.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have three books to read and then there of course are
          many materials online to read. First, I'm going to work
          through the New Testament of the Latin
          Vulgate&mdash;I'll have to do some more research but the
          goal is that I get some of the advantages of reading the
          (source) Greek texts (e.g. preserved word orderings)
          using a language/vocabulary that is more familiar to me.
          I then have the two volumes of <i>Lingua Latina Per Se
            Illustrata</i> (Hans H. Ørberg) to learn some things
          about life in ancient Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've found <a href="https://www.wiktionary.org/">Wiktionary</a> to be
          a helpful resource for viewing (correct) noun declensions while
          learning my grammar basics.
        </p>

        <h2>Grammar and Software</h2>
        <p>
          Learning Latin means memorizing a whole lot of details.
          Fortunately, these details are fairly well laid out in
          tables, books, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Latin lends itself well to automated stuff&mdash;I will
          be sharing tools I create here.
