                    See first
                    <a href="http://wcdrutgers.net/Latin.htm">Latin by the
                        Dowling Method</a>. There are many people who have successfully
                    employed this method or variations thereof. Learning Latin, I am
                    <i>not going to shy away from "rote memorization"</i>. Indeed,
                    at the end of the day, this is the method I had to use to learn
                    many Chinese characters/<i>Kanji</i>. Strong foundations in the
                    basic forms of a language make learning after that much quicker.
                    If it seems too "stupid" of a method, consider how doing pushups
                    doesn't really "get anything done" in the world. But by doing
                    this type of motion, you can build strength for heavier lifting
                    later.

                <p>
                    I'm using <i>Wheelock's Latin</i> (7 ed.) as a kind of
                    Grammar outline/reference. I bought this book early on, and
                    wouldn't necessarily suggest it as a starting place, but it
                    does have correct Latin sentences and in that way
                    it is useful. Better, are more concise, well organized resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will memorize the
                    declension paradigms, conjugation tables, and other
                    systematic aspects of Latin using the charts in
                    the <i>Pocket Oxford Latin Dictionary</i>. While doing
                    that (will take some time to memorize everything), I'll
                    quickly go through <i>Wheelock's</i> to get a sense of
                    which syntactic structures are available. With a grasp
                    of (1) what the forms of Latin are (from memorizing the
                    tables) and (2) how the language is put together (from a
                    cursory overview of a grammar book) I'll then be able to
                    start reading extensively to acquire a working knowledge
                    of the language.

                    I have three books to read and then there of course are
                    many materials online to read. First, I'm going to work
                    through the New Testament of the Latin
                    Vulgate&mdash;I'll have to do some more research but the
                    goal is that I get some of the advantages of reading the
                    (source) Greek texts (e.g. preserved word orderings)
                    using a language/vocabulary that is more familiar to me.
                    I then have the two volumes of <i>Lingua Latina Per Se
                        Illustrata</i> (Hans H. Ã˜rberg) to learn some things
                    about life in ancient Rome.
