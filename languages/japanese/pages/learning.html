                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>
                    If you're a beginner to Japanese, you must do the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Learn to read/write <i>kana</i> (<i>hiragana</i> and
                        <i>katakana</i>) as this will be very useful for learning new
                        vocabulary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Distinguish <b>long/short</b> vowels. When memorizing words, pay attention to this
                        <b>contrastive feature</b> (can be used to differentiate Japanese words)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Memorize essential phrases for communication&mdash;purchasing a phrase book
                        or using online resources should be sufficient for this.
                        When consooming Japanese media, pay attention to when these are used. How
                        do people act when they first meet? When they return home? When to leave a 
                        meeting/gathering?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After following the steps above, you will want to familiarize yourself with all
                    the different kinds of <b>forms</b> you will see in Japanese.
                    Nouns are easy. Noun forms are <em>invariant</em>&mdash;they always sound the same
                    (unlike in a language like Latin or Russian which have grammatical <b>case</b>).
                    What you will need to familiarize yourself with are the so-called "<b>particles</b>"
                    of Japanese. Learn to recognize <i>-wa, -de, -ga, -mo, -na</i> and <i>-ni</i> in speech.
                    Study how these are used to used to signify relationships between words in Japanese.
                    Recognize nouns and then how these particles are added to those nouns to show their
                    roles in sentences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learn the verb and adjective conjugations. Compared with those of European languages,
                    they're quite consistent. With adjectives, you'll learn of (1) <i>-i</i> type adjectives
                    and (2) <i>-na</i> type adjectives. Learn the rules for conjugating these.
                    For verbs, you'll learn to distinguish between (1) <i>ichidan</i> and (2) <i>godan</i>
                    verbs, as well as two irregulars: <span lang="ja">する</span> <i>suru</i> (do) and
                    <span lang="ja">来る</span> <i>kuru</i> (come).
                    You'll see/hear these all over the place; just memorize them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't mind writing too much&mdash;focus on hearing and memorizing <em>words</em> and
                    observing how they fit into sentences. Know that children first know how to speak
                    fluent Japanese and then they build up their vocabulary while learning writing.
                    Given the relatively sparse grammar of Japanese, you can quickly acquire communicative
                    competence.
