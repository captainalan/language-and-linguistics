          Much of this article is devoted to <em>written</em>
          Japanese because from a practical standpoint, you're going
          to have to engage with a lot of Japanese writing if you
          are going to engage the arts of Japan or gain a beyond-conversational
          level command of Japanese.

        <p>
          The study of any language cannot be separated from the land(s) in
          which it is spoken. The nation of Japan is roughly the side of
          California and has a relatively large population&mdash;about 130 million.
          This is roughly half the population of California. So you can imagine if
          half of Americans moved to California, and then an earthquake separated
          California from the mainland USA (also, make those Americans better at
          waiting in lines and a bit more polite).
        </p>
        <p>
          Geographically, Japan is very diverse. There are mountains, oceans, rivers,
          places where it does(n't) snow, and more&mdash;the climate of the modern
          nation of Japan has a whole cannot be reduced to a simple description and
          as different regions of Japan have their own patterns. As with China, Japan's
          population is concentrated along coastal lands in large cities, with less
          dense populations in inland forest and mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many representative features of Japanese civilization can be found in
          the standard emojis of Unicode many of us use everyday.
          You will notice that the "standard"
          emoji set includes many more Japanese cultural things than it does for
          other cultures of the world: üéêüé¥üÄÑüí¥üç±üç£üçôüçõüçµ... Indeed, emojis
          have their origins in 90s Japanese popular phone culture.

        <h2>Spoken Japanese</h2>
        <p>
          Distinctive features of "the sound" of Japanese
          include <em>very simple syllable
            structure</em>, <em>relatively few vowels (5)</em>
          and <em>contrasts between long and short vowels</em>.
          Japanese has more different sounds than
          say... Hawaiian. But it has less than the Indo-European
          languages. Many people find this <span class="term">euphonic</span> ("good
          sounding"). Most Japanese words can be readily pronounced
          intelligibly ("so that it can be understood") by native
          English speakers, with only a minute or two of
          explanation. As such, English has many Japanese loan words
          (compare this to harder-to-pronounce languages like
          Russian, Chinese, or Vietnamese).
        </p>
        <p>
          Providing some details on some of these words you are
          probably already familiar with can illuminate various
          aspects of how Japanese sounds:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b><span lang="ja">sushi ÂØøÂè∏</span></b>&mdash;English speakers will pronounce the
            'u' different than Japanese speakers, but it will still
            be understandable
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><span lang="ja">tsunami Ê¥•Ê≥¢</span></b>&mdash;English speakers often pronounce
            the 'ts' as just a 's'; this is a harder one
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><span lang="ja">Tokyo Êù±‰∫¨</span></b>&mdash;English speakers won't pronounce the
            'o's in this word as "long" (duration)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><span lang="ja">samurai ‰æç</span></b>&mdash;The Japanese 'r' sounds more like
            the middle <span class="term">flap</span> sound
            in <i>butter</i> (American English pronunciation) than
            the 'r's in <i>railroad</i>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><span lang="ja">Zen Á¶Ö</span></b>&mdash; ...
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Speakers of English will be able recognize many words in
          spoken Japanese, particularly in settings that require
          lots of these "loan" words. For instance,
          in <span lang="ja">anime „Ç¢„Éã„É°</span>, you get a lot of
          these sorts of words as Japanese people use foreign
          borrowings to make stuff that sounds cool to them, similar to how you&mdash;dear weeb&mdash;probably things
          automatically sound cooler in Japanese > English.
        </p>

        <h3>Grammar</h3>
        <p>
          In many ways, Japanese grammar is easier to learn than
          that of European languages, including English. Japanese
          has far less "irregular verbs" than English and its
          conjugation rules are fairly straight forward. Japanese
          grammar is well-studied and ample resources exist to get
          more details if you need them.
        </p>
        <p>
          One area where Japanese Grammar reflects Japanese society
          is in its use of many different politeness/formality
          levels. There are discrete levels reflected in verb
          conjugations and word choice, with no analog in English as
          I know it. In some European languages, this might be
          comparable to different forms of "you"
          (c.f. <a href="../spanish/index.html">Spanish</a> <i lang="es">t√∫</i>
          vs <i lang="es">ust√©d</i>). Learning to use Japanese in a
          "proper", native-like way will mean learning enough
          Japanese culture stuff to know what is appropriate in what
          circumstances and the corresponding linguistic forms to go
          with those situations. In English, on the other hand,
          talking politely with people of all sorts basically
          follows the same form. You could say "Hello, how are you?"
          to the CEO of a company or a person younger that you've
          known for years, and it would be fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Japanese, on the other hand, grammatically distinguishes
          different ways of talking to different sorts of people.
          Japanese teachers are more likely than not to be quite
          strict in instructing you on speaking appropriately to
          others. Learning texts most usually start with the
          "<i>desu</i> form" of generic polite speaking, giving you
          sentences like <span lang="ja">ÁßÅ„ÅØÂ≠¶Áîü„Åß„Åô <i>Watashi wa
              gakusei desu</i></span> "I am a student". Meeting polite
          (Japanese) society and using sentences like this with a
          warm smile and sincere intent, you are certainly to be
          received well enough. Trying out phrases you learned from
          anime right from the start may get you thrown into the
          weeb trashcan.

        <p>
          Many Japanese verb forms may appear long and tedious to
          pronounce when first seen in writing. For example, <span lang="ja">Ë°å„Åç„Åæ
            „Åó„Åü <i>ikimashita</i></span> "went" is a whopping 5 written
          syllable things to say "went". In practice, this isn't so
          bad because (like every other language) various rules of
          simplification or "assimilation" apply to make what look
          like long, complicated words pronounced more
          "lazily". Clear articulation means pronouncing out all
          segments clearly, but spoken at normal speed, stuff gets
          smashed together.

        <h2>Written Japanese</h2>
        <p>
          Written Japanese looks really cool but it is ridiculously
          complicated. Japanese uses at least four different scripts:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b><span lang="ja">Kanji</span></b> (Chinese characters)</li>
          <li><b><span lang="ja">Hiragana</span></b> (Japanese <span lang="ja">kana</span>)</li>
          <li><b><span lang="ja">Katakana</span></b> (Japanese <span lang="ja">kana</span>)</li>
          <li><b><span lang="ja">R≈çmaji</span></b> (Latin characters)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A typical (21st century) text will contain a blend of all
          of these. <i>Kanji</i> and <i>hiragana</i> will both
          nearly always appear in a randomly given sentence and you
          are likely to see <i>Katakana</i> and <i>R≈çmaji</i>
          whenever foreign stuff (usually English derived) is
          discussed, including in contexts like business,
          technology, and the arts.

        <p>
          <b><span lang="ja">Kanji Êº¢Â≠ó</span></b> (Chinese
          characters) are the worst! They are also everywhere in
          Japanese texts I have
          an <a href="../chinese/characters.html">entire article</a>
          dedicated to talking about how they work (and suck!).
          Though that article is mostly in the context of Chinese,
          pretty much everything discussed there applies to
          Japanese <span lang="ja">kanji</span>.
          Learning <span lang="ja">kanji</span> is tedious and will
          likely make you (more) myopic. There is a price to pay
          obtain higher levels of weeb-dom. Note that in Japanese,
          Kanji typically have <em>at least</em> two different
          pronunciations: the
          so-called <b><span lang="ja"><i>on-</i>yomi Èü≥Ë™≠
              „Åø</span></b> (corresponding to older Chinese
          pronunciations of characters)
          and <b><span lang="ja"><i>kun-</i>yomi Ë®ìË™≠„Åø</span></b>
          (corresponding to Japanese meaning-based readings of
          characters). Thus the character ÂõΩ "nation" is
          pronounced <i><span lang="ja">kuni</span></i>
          (a <span lang="ja"><i>kun-</i>yomi</span>) as a
          stand-alone native Japanese word, but in compounds is
          pronounced like <span lang="ja">koku</span>
          or <span lang="ja">goku</span> as in <span lang="ja">Á±≥ÂõΩ
            beikoku</span> "America", <span lang="ja">‰∏≠ÂõΩ
            chuugoku</span> "China", and <span lang="ja">ÂõΩÊ∞ë
            kokumin</span> "people" (of a nation). Deciding whether to
          use <span lang="ja"><i>on-</i>yomi</span>
          or <span lang="ja"><i>kun-</i>yomi</span> becomes easier
          with practice but this doesn't change the fact that
          learning to read <span lang="ja">kanji</span> is a big
          pain that can only be accomplished through hundreds
          (thousands?) of hours of repeated exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Japanese <b><span lang="ja">kana ‰ªÆÂêç</span></b> include
          the <b><span lang="ja">hiragana Âπ≥‰ªÆÂêç</span></b>
          and <b><span lang="ja">katakana Áâá‰ªÆÂêç</span></b>
          <span class="term">syllabaries</span> (if anyone suggests that these
          are <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually"><em>acckkkkktually</em></a>
          something
          called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_(linguistics)"><i>"mora"</i></a>,
          tell them to define terms and walk away while they
          gesticulate and wallow in abstractions).
          <span lang="ja">Hiragana</span> look like little
          squiggles (e.g. vowels of Japanese: <span lang="ja">„ÅÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÜ
            „Åà„Åä a, i, u, e, o)</span> and are used mainly to write
          many grammatical elements of Japanese&mdash;endings of
          verbs, conjunctions linking phrases, and the like. They
          are also used to write many word, especially ones of
          Japanese origin. You will see them
          everywhere. <span lang="ja">Katakana</span> looks
          similar to Hiragana but much blockier (c.f. vowels <span lang="ja">„Ç¢„Ç§„Ç¶„Ç®„Ç™ a, i, u, e, o</span>).
          They are mainly used to write foreign loan words, newly
          coined terms (e.g. product names), and some scientific
          stuff such as the species of organisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Japanese-language materials targed at
          learners&mdash;such as materials for school children or
          relatively advanced learners&mdash; content is often
          sorted by a fixed ordering of <span lang="ja">kana</span>.
          When learning Japanese, you will likely be exposed to this
          ordering, which is based off syllable rather than initial
          "letter/sound". So the ordering
          beings: <span lang="ja"><i>a, i, u, e, o; ka, ki, ku, ke,
              ko...</i></span>. <span lang="ja">Kana</span> are also used
          to annotate <i>Kanji</i> in learning materials. You
          definitely should learn <span lang="ja">kana</span> if you
          intend to study Japanese seriously as they will allow you
          to effectively use Japanese pop-up dictionaries to
          decipher Kanji (more on that later).
        </p>

        <p>
          Latin characters are also learned by pretty much all
          Japanese people. For typing Japanese on the computer,
          typically people type in Latin characters (the "English
          Alphabet") and candidates of Japanese words magically
          appear from a pop-up list. Then, the correct things are
          chosen (see Xah Lee's
          "<a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/Japan_input_method.html">Japan
            Input Method</a>" (2019) for more details). Various
          systems exist for the <span class="term">Romanization</span> of
          Japanese&mdash;writing Japanese in the Latin ("English")
          alphabet. You are most likely to
          encounter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization">Hepburn
            romanization</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond being used as a tool for working with Japanese,
          Latin characters are commonly seen in foreign things,
          product names, and artistic creations.

        <h2 class="text-center">Navigating Written and Spoken Japanese</h2>
        <p>
          Japan is a pretty literate place, with book stores (and
          little screens) all over its big cities. Education is
          relatively unified from what I hear, with all Japanese
          schoolchildren being drilled with near-identical language
          standards across the nation. Japan thus has a very rich
          and sophisticated literary tradition that appears to be
          alive and well, all things considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Engaging a lot of written content may give you the
          impression that Japan is drowning in a sea of words. You
          may be afraid to ever go outside and speak any Japanese.
          Meanwhile, your partying friend who can't be bothered to
          read a book like ever may be speaking freely
          (<span lang="ja">„Å∫„Çâ„Å∫„Çâ pera-pera</span>) with all sorts
          of people in idiomatic Japanese, overall having a great
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          From being the former (nerd) in the little sketch above, I
          would suggest to treat Japanese as two seaparte worlds: a
          spoken and a written one. Weakness in spoken Japanese is
          easily improved by talking to people or watching videos
          (lots on YouTube) of Japanese people talking about
          whatever. If you are feeling anti-social, there is a
          bottomless pit of written Japanese to swim in. But don't
          get stuck in that pit if there are things to mix in RL
          (real life)!
        </p>
        <p>
          Listening and speaking should be your main
          concern&mdash;writing will follow if you put in the
          time/effort to study that as well. You can think of
          reading as ultimately being about <em>word
            recognition</em>. Once you recognize a <em>spoken</em>
          word it is easier to associate an associated written form
          than to try to memorize a whole load of new information
          (e.g. how to write a word) at once.

        <h3>Free Online Resources</h3>
        <p>
          Combined with media binging (YouTube, anime, whatever)
          these resources should be sufficient to get you
          comfortable with Japanese.

        <p>
          Books/print resources; not free (as in free beer), but can
          often be acquired very inexpensively secondhand. Many
          high-quality online resources exist.
