	  <h1>Japanese</h1>
	  <p>
	    By <a href="https://captainalan.github.io">Alan W</a> &mdash;
	    Last updated April 10, 2020
	  </p> 
	  <p>
	    Sup weebs. This article is an introduction to (standard)
	    Japanese. It is an opinionated, descriptive account of
	    that language written to be useful to anyone considering
	    investing more time in learning Japanese.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Much of this article is devoted to <em>written</em>
	    Japanese because from a practical standpoint, you're going
	    to have to engage with a lot of Japanese writing if you
	    use Japanese to do nerd stuff, which the majority
	    (probably) of people that seriously study Japanese as a
	    foreign language are into. 
	  </p>

	  <h2>Spoken Japanese</h2>
	  <p>
	    Distinctive features of "the sound" of Japanese
	    include <em>very simple syllable
	    structure</em>, <em>relatively few vowels (5)</em>
	    and <em>contrasts between long and short vowels</em>.
	    Japanese has more different sounds than
	    say... Hawaiian. But it has less than the Indo-European
	    languages. Many people find this <b>euphonic</b> ("good
	    sounding"). Most Japanese words can be readily pronounced
	    intelligibly ("so that it can be understood") by native
	    English speakers, with only a minute or two of
	    explanation. As such, English has many Japanese loan words
	    (compare this to harder-to-pronounce languages like
	    Russian, Chinese, or Vietnamese). 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Providing some details on some of these words you are
	    probably already familiar with can illuminate various
	    aspects of how Japanese sounds:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <i>sushi</i>&mdash;English speakers will pronounce the
	      'u' different than Japanese speakers, but it will still
	      be understandable
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <i>tsunami</i>&mdash;English speakers often pronounce
	      the 'ts' as just a 's'; this is a harder one
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <i>Tokyo</i>&mdash;English speakers won't pronounce the
	      'o's in this word as "long" (duration)
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <i>samurai</i>&mdash;The Japanese 'r' sounds more like
	      the middle <b>flap</b> sound in <i>butter</i> (American
	      English pronunciation) than the 'r's in <i>railroad</i>.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <i>Zen</i>&mdash; ...
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Speakers of English will be able recognize many words in
	    spoken Japanese, particularly in settings that require
	    lots of these "loan" words. In Anime, you get a lot
	    of these sorts of words (Japanese people using foreign
	    borrowings to make stuff that sounds cool to them).
	  </p>

	  <h3>Grammar</h3>
	  <p>
	    In many ways, Japanese grammar is easier to learn than
	    that of European languages, including English. Japanese
	    has far less "irregular verbs" than English and its
	    conjugation rules are fairly straight forward. Japanese
	    grammar is well-studied and ample resources exist to get
	    more details if you need them.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    One area where Japanese Grammar reflects Japanese society
	    is in its use of many different politeness/formality
	    levels. There are discrete levels reflected in verb
	    conjugations and word choice, with no analog in English as
	    I know it. In some European languages, this might be
	    comparable to different forms of "you"
	    (c.f. Spanish <i>tú</i> vs <i>ustéd</i>).  Learning to use
	    Japanese in a "proper", native-like way will mean learning
	    enough Japanese culture stuff to know what is appropriate
	    in what circumstances and the corresponding linguistic
	    forms to go with those situations. In English, on the
	    other hand, talking politely with people of all sorts
	    basically follows the same form. You could say "Hello, how
	    are you?" to the CEO of a company or a person younger that
	    you've known for years, and it would be fine.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Japanese, on the other hand, grammatically distinguishes
	    different ways of talking to different sorts of
	    people. Japanese teachers are more likely than not to be
	    quite strict in instructing you on speaking appropriately
	    to others. Learning texts most usually start with the
	    "<i>desu</i> form" of generic polite speaking, giving you
	    sentences like 私は学生です <i>Watashi wa gakusei desu</i>
	    "I am a student". Meeting polite (Japanese) society and
	    using sentences like this with a warm smile and sincere
	    intent, you are certainly to be received well enough.
	    Trying out phrases you learned from anime right from the
	    start may get you thrown into the weeb trashcan.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Many Japanese verb forms may appear long and tedious to
	    pronounce when first seen in writing. For example, 行きま
	    した <em>iki.mashita</em> "went" is a whopping 5 written
	    syllable things to say "went". In practice, this isn't so
	    bad because (like every other language) various rules of
	    simplification or "assimilation" apply to make what look
	    like long, complicated words pronounced more
	    "lazily". Clear articulation means pronouncing out all
	    segments clearly, but spoken at normal speed, stuff gets
	    smashed together. 
	  </p>

	  <h2>Written Japanese</h2>
	  <p>
	    Written Japanese looks really cool but it is ridiculously
	    complicated. Japanese uses at least four different scripts:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><i>Kanji</i> (Chinese characters)</li>
	    <li><i>Hiragana</i> (Japanese <i>kana</i>)</li>
	    <li><i>Katakana</i> (Japanese <i>kana</i>)</li>
	    <li><i>Rōmaji</i> (Latin characters)</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    A typical (21st century) text will contain a blend of all
	    of these. <i>Kanji</i> and <i>hiragana</i> will both
	    nearly always appear in a randomly given sentence and you
	    are likely to see <i>Katakana</i> and <i>Rōmaji</i>
	    whenever foreign stuff (usually English derived) is
	    discussed, including in contexts like business,
	    technology, and the arts.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <b><i>Kanji</i></b> (Chinese characters) are the worst!
	    They are also everywhere in Japanese texts I have
	    an <a href="../chinese/characters.html">entire article</a>
	    dedicated to talking about how they work (and
	    suck!). Though that article is mostly in the context of
	    Chinese, pretty much everything discussed there applies to
	    Japanese <i>kanji</i>. Learning <i>kanji</i> is tedious
	    and will likely make you (more) myopic. There is a price
	    to pay obtain higher levels of weeb-dom. Note that in
	    Japanese, Kanji typically have <em>at least</em> two
	    different pronunciations: the
	    so-called <b><i>on-</i>yomi</b> (corresponding to older
	    Chinese pronunciations of characters)
	    and <b><i>kun-</i>yomi</b> (corresponding to Japanese
	    meaning-based readings of characters). Thus the character
	    国 "nation" is pronounced <i>kuni</i> (a <i>kun-</i>yomi)
	    as a stand-alone native Japanese word, but in compounds is
	    pronounced like <i>koku</i> or <i>goku</i> as in 米
	    国 <i>beikoku</i> "America",　中国　<i>chuugoku</i>
	    "China", and 国民 <i>kokumin</i> "people" (of a nation).
	    Deciding whether to use <i>on-</i>yomi or <i>kun-</i>yomi
	    becomes easier with practice (assuring, isn't it?) but
	    this doesn't change the fact that learning to read <i>kanji</i>
	    is a big pain in the butt.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Japanese <b>kana</b> include the <b><i>hiragana</i></b>
	    and <b><i>katakana</i></b> syllabaries (if anyone suggests
	    that these
	    are <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually"><em>acckkkkktually</em></a> 
	    something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_(linguistics)"><i>"mora"</i></a>,
	    tell them to define terms and walk away while they
	    gesticulate and wallow in abstractions).
	    <i>Hiragana</i> look like little squiggles (see: あいうえ
	    お) and are used mainly to write many grammatical elements
	    of Japanese&mdash;endings of verbs, conjunctions linking
	    phrases, and the like. They are also used to write many
	    word, especially ones of Japanese origin. You will see
	    them everywhere. <i>Katakana</i> looks similar to Hiragana
	    but much blockier (see: アイウエオ). They are mainly used
	    to write foreign loan words, newly coined terms
	    (e.g. product names), and some scientific stuff such as
	    the species of organisms.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In Japanese-language materials targed at
	    learners&mdash;such as materials for school children or
	    relatively advanced learners&mdash; content is often
	    sorted by a fixed ordering of <i>kana</i>. When learning
	    Japanese, you will likely be exposed to this ordering,
	    which is based off <b>syllable</b> rather than initial
	    "letter/sound". So the ordering beings: <i>a, i, u, e, o;
	    ka, ki, ku, ke, ko...</i>. <i>Kana</i> are also used to
	    annotate <i>Kanji</i> in learning materials. You
	    definitely should learn <i>kana</i> if you intend to study
	    Japanese seriously as they will allow you to effectively
	    use Japanese pop-up dictionaries to decipher Kanji (more
	    on that later).
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Latin characters are also learned by pretty much all
	    Japanese people. For typing Japanese on the computer,
	    typically people type in Latin characters (the "English
	    Alphabet") and candidates of Japanese words magically
	    appear from a pop-up list. Then, the correct things are
	    chosen (see Xah Lee's
	    "<a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/Japan_input_method.html">Japan
	    Input Method</a>" (2019) for more details).  Various
	    systems exist for the <b>Romanization</b> of
	    Japanese&mdash;writing Japanese in the Latin ("English")
	    alphabet. You are most likely to
	    encounter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization">Hepburn
	    romanization</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Beyond being used as a tool for working with Japanese,
	    Latin characters are commonly seen in foreign things,
	    product names, and artistic creations.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Navigating Written and Spoken Japanese</h2>
	  <p>
	    Japan is a pretty literate place, with book stores (and
	    little screens) all over its big cities. Education is
	    relatively unified from what I hear, with all Japanese
	    schoolchildren being drilled with near-identical language
	    standards across the nation. Japan thus has a very rich
	    and sophisticated literary tradition that appears to be
	    alive and well, all things considered.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Engaging a lot of written content may give you the
	    impression that Japan is drowning in a sea of words. You
	    may be afraid to ever go outside and speak any
	    Japanese. Meanwhile, your partying friend who can't be
	    bothered to read a book like ever may be speaking freely
	    (<i>pera-pera</i>) with all sorts of people in idiomatic
	    Japanese, overall having a great time.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    From being the former (nerd) in the little sketch above, I
	    would suggest to treat Japanese as two seaparte worlds: a
	    spoken and a written one. Weakness in spoken Japanese is
	    easily improved by talking to people or watching videos
	    (lots on YouTube) of Japanese people talking about
	    whatever. If you are feeling anti-social, there is a
	    bottomless pit of written Japanese to swim in. But don't
	    get stuck in that pit if there are things to mix in RL
	    (real life)!

	  <h2>Links and Resources</h2>
	  <p>
	    Resources for learning to use Japanese are
	    plentiful. Here, I just list English language resources
	    that have been helpful to me. If you already speak Korean
	    or Chinese, you may find resources in those languages more
	    useful as you can leverage your existing East Asian
	    knowledge to learn faster. As with any other language, the
	    sooner you can get to the stage where you can learn about
	    Japanese <em>in Japanese</em>, the better. From there on,
	    you can LARP as a Japanese person on the Internet.

	  <h3>Free Online Resources</h3>
	  <p>
	    Combined with media binging (YouTube, anime, whatever)
	    these resources should be sufficient to get you
	    comfortable with Japanese.
