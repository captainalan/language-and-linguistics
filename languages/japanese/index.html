            Sup weebs. This article is an introduction to (standard)
            Japanese. It is an opinionated, descriptive account of
            that language written to be useful to anyone considering
            investing more time in learning Japanese.
          </p>
          <p>
            Much of this article is devoted to <em>written</em>
            Japanese because from a practical standpoint, you're going
            to have to engage with a lot of Japanese writing if you
            use Japanese to do nerd stuff, which the majority
            (probably) of people that seriously study Japanese as a
            foreign language are into.

          <h2>Spoken Japanese</h2>
          <p>
            Distinctive features of "the sound" of Japanese
            include <em>very simple syllable
              structure</em>, <em>relatively few vowels (5)</em>
            and <em>contrasts between long and short vowels</em>.
            Japanese has more different sounds than
            say... Hawaiian. But it has less than the Indo-European
            languages. Many people find this <span class="term">euphonic</span> ("good
            sounding"). Most Japanese words can be readily pronounced
            intelligibly ("so that it can be understood") by native
            English speakers, with only a minute or two of
            explanation. As such, English has many Japanese loan words
            (compare this to harder-to-pronounce languages like
            Russian, Chinese, or Vietnamese). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Providing some details on some of these words you are
            probably already familiar with can illuminate various
            aspects of how Japanese sounds:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b><span lang="ja">sushi 寿司</span></b>&mdash;English speakers will pronounce the
              'u' different than Japanese speakers, but it will still
              be understandable
            </li>
            <li>
              <b><span lang="ja">tsunami 津波</span></b>&mdash;English speakers often pronounce
              the 'ts' as just a 's'; this is a harder one
            </li>
            <li>
              <b><span lang="ja">Tokyo 東京</span></b>&mdash;English speakers won't pronounce the
              'o's in this word as "long" (duration)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b><span lang="ja">samurai 侍</span></b>&mdash;The Japanese 'r' sounds more like
              the middle <span class="term">flap</span> sound
              in <i>butter</i> (American English pronunciation) than
              the 'r's in <i>railroad</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b><span lang="ja">Zen 禅</span></b>&mdash; ...
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Speakers of English will be able recognize many words in
            spoken Japanese, particularly in settings that require
            lots of these "loan" words. For instance,
            in <span lang="ja">anime アニメ</span>, you get a lot of
            these sorts of words as Japanese people use foreign
            borrowings to make stuff that sounds cool to them, similar to how you&mdash;dear weeb&mdash;probably things automatically sound cooler in Japanese > English.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Grammar</h3>
          <p>
            In many ways, Japanese grammar is easier to learn than
            that of European languages, including English. Japanese
            has far less "irregular verbs" than English and its
            conjugation rules are fairly straight forward. Japanese
            grammar is well-studied and ample resources exist to get
            more details if you need them.
          </p>
          <p>
            One area where Japanese Grammar reflects Japanese society
            is in its use of many different politeness/formality
            levels. There are discrete levels reflected in verb
            conjugations and word choice, with no analog in English as
            I know it. In some European languages, this might be
            comparable to different forms of "you"
            (c.f. <a href="../spanish/index.html">Spanish</a> <i lang="es">tú</i>
            vs <i lang="es">ustéd</i>). Learning to use Japanese in a
            "proper", native-like way will mean learning enough
            Japanese culture stuff to know what is appropriate in what
            circumstances and the corresponding linguistic forms to go
            with those situations. In English, on the other hand,
            talking politely with people of all sorts basically
            follows the same form. You could say "Hello, how are you?"
            to the CEO of a company or a person younger that you've
            known for years, and it would be fine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Japanese, on the other hand, grammatically distinguishes
            different ways of talking to different sorts of people.
            Japanese teachers are more likely than not to be quite
            strict in instructing you on speaking appropriately to
            others. Learning texts most usually start with the
            "<i>desu</i> form" of generic polite speaking, giving you
            sentences like <span lang="ja">私は学生です <i>Watashi wa
            gakusei desu</i></span> "I am a student". Meeting polite
            (Japanese) society and using sentences like this with a
            warm smile and sincere intent, you are certainly to be
            received well enough. Trying out phrases you learned from
            anime right from the start may get you thrown into the
            weeb trashcan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many Japanese verb forms may appear long and tedious to
            pronounce when first seen in writing. For example, <span lang="ja">行きま
            した <i>ikimashita</i></span> "went" is a whopping 5 written
            syllable things to say "went". In practice, this isn't so
            bad because (like every other language) various rules of
            simplification or "assimilation" apply to make what look
            like long, complicated words pronounced more
            "lazily". Clear articulation means pronouncing out all
            segments clearly, but spoken at normal speed, stuff gets
            smashed together. 
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="col-md-6">
          <h2>Written Japanese</h2>
          <p>
            Written Japanese looks really cool but it is ridiculously
            complicated. Japanese uses at least four different scripts:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><b><span lang="ja">Kanji</span></b> (Chinese characters)</li>
            <li><b><span lang="ja">Hiragana</span></b> (Japanese <span lang="ja">kana</span>)</li>
            <li><b><span lang="ja">Katakana</span></b> (Japanese <span lang="ja">kana</span>)</li>
            <li><b><span lang="ja">Rōmaji</span></b> (Latin characters)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A typical (21st century) text will contain a blend of all
            of these. <i>Kanji</i> and <i>hiragana</i> will both
            nearly always appear in a randomly given sentence and you
            are likely to see <i>Katakana</i> and <i>Rōmaji</i>
            whenever foreign stuff (usually English derived) is
            discussed, including in contexts like business,
            technology, and the arts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b><span lang="ja">Kanji 漢字</span></b> (Chinese
            characters) are the worst! They are also everywhere in
            Japanese texts I have
            an <a href="../chinese/characters.html">entire article</a>
            dedicated to talking about how they work (and suck!).
            Though that article is mostly in the context of Chinese,
            pretty much everything discussed there applies to
            Japanese <span lang="ja">kanji</span>.
            Learning <span lang="ja">kanji</span> is tedious and will
            likely make you (more) myopic. There is a price to pay
            obtain higher levels of weeb-dom. Note that in Japanese,
            Kanji typically have <em>at least</em> two different
            pronunciations: the
            so-called <b><span lang="ja"><i>on-</i>yomi 音読
            み</span></b> (corresponding to older Chinese
            pronunciations of characters)
            and <b><span lang="ja"><i>kun-</i>yomi 訓読み</span></b>
            (corresponding to Japanese meaning-based readings of
            characters). Thus the character 国 "nation" is
            pronounced <i><span lang="ja">kuni</span></i>
            (a <span lang="ja"><i>kun-</i>yomi</span>) as a
            stand-alone native Japanese word, but in compounds is
            pronounced like <span lang="ja">koku</span>
            or <span lang="ja">goku</span> as in <span lang="ja">米国
            beikoku</span> "America", <span lang="ja">中国
            chuugoku</span> "China", and <span lang="ja">国民
            kokumin</span> "people" (of a nation). Deciding whether to
            use <span lang="ja"><i>on-</i>yomi</span>
            or <span lang="ja"><i>kun-</i>yomi</span> becomes easier
            with practice but this doesn't change the fact that
            learning to read <span lang="ja">kanji</span> is a big
            pain that can only be accomplished through hundreds
            (thousands?) of hours of repeated exposure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Japanese <b><span lang="ja">kana 仮名</span></b> include
            the <b><span lang="ja">hiragana 平仮名</span></b>
            and <b><span lang="ja">katakana 片仮名</span></b>
            <span class="term">syllabaries</span> (if anyone suggests that these
            are <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually"><em>acckkkkktually</em></a>
            something
            called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_(linguistics)"><i>"mora"</i></a>,
            tell them to define terms and walk away while they
            gesticulate and wallow in abstractions).
            <span lang="ja">Hiragana</span> look like little
            squiggles (e.g. vowels of Japanese: <span lang="ja">あいう
            えお a, i, u, e, o)</span> and are used mainly to write
            many grammatical elements of Japanese&mdash;endings of
            verbs, conjunctions linking phrases, and the like. They
            are also used to write many word, especially ones of
            Japanese origin. You will see them
            everywhere. <span lang="ja">Katakana</span> looks
            similar to Hiragana but much blockier (c.f. vowels <span lang="ja">アイウエオ a, i, u, e, o</span>).
            They are mainly used to write foreign loan words, newly
            coined terms (e.g. product names), and some scientific
            stuff such as the species of organisms.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Japanese-language materials targed at
            learners&mdash;such as materials for school children or
            relatively advanced learners&mdash; content is often
            sorted by a fixed ordering of <span lang="ja">kana</span>.
            When learning Japanese, you will likely be exposed to this
            ordering, which is based off syllable rather than initial
            "letter/sound". So the ordering
            beings: <span lang="ja"><i>a, i, u, e, o; ka, ki, ku, ke,
            ko...</i></span>. <span lang="ja">Kana</span> are also used
            to annotate <i>Kanji</i> in learning materials. You
            definitely should learn <span lang="ja">kana</span> if you
            intend to study Japanese seriously as they will allow you
            to effectively use Japanese pop-up dictionaries to
            decipher Kanji (more on that later).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Latin characters are also learned by pretty much all
            Japanese people. For typing Japanese on the computer,
            typically people type in Latin characters (the "English
            Alphabet") and candidates of Japanese words magically
            appear from a pop-up list. Then, the correct things are
            chosen (see Xah Lee's
            "<a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/Japan_input_method.html">Japan
              Input Method</a>" (2019) for more details).  Various
            systems exist for the <span class="term">Romanization</span> of
            Japanese&mdash;writing Japanese in the Latin ("English")
            alphabet. You are most likely to
            encounter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization">Hepburn
              romanization</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond being used as a tool for working with Japanese,
            Latin characters are commonly seen in foreign things,
            product names, and artistic creations.

          <h2 class="text-center">Navigating Written and Spoken Japanese</h2>
          <p>
            Japan is a pretty literate place, with book stores (and
            little screens) all over its big cities. Education is
            relatively unified from what I hear, with all Japanese
            schoolchildren being drilled with near-identical language
            standards across the nation. Japan thus has a very rich
            and sophisticated literary tradition that appears to be
            alive and well, all things considered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Engaging a lot of written content may give you the
            impression that Japan is drowning in a sea of words. You
            may be afraid to ever go outside and speak any
            Japanese. Meanwhile, your partying friend who can't be
            bothered to read a book like ever may be speaking freely
            (<i>pera-pera</i>) with all sorts of people in idiomatic
            Japanese, overall having a great time.
          </p>
          <p>
            From being the former (nerd) in the little sketch above, I
            would suggest to treat Japanese as two seaparte worlds: a
            spoken and a written one. Weakness in spoken Japanese is
            easily improved by talking to people or watching videos
            (lots on YouTube) of Japanese people talking about
            whatever. If you are feeling anti-social, there is a
            bottomless pit of written Japanese to swim in. But don't
            get stuck in that pit if there are things to mix in RL
            (real life)!

            Resources for learning to use Japanese are

            that have been helpful to me. If you already speak Korean
            or Chinese, you may find resources in those languages more
            useful as you can leverage your existing East Asian
            knowledge to learn faster. As with any other language, the
            sooner you can get to the stage where you can learn about
            Japanese <em>in Japanese</em>, the better. From there on,
            you can LARP as a Japanese person on the Internet.
