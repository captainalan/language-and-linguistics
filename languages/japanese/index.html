	    Sup weebs. The Japanese language needs no marketing; anime
	    already did this.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Spoken Japanese</h2>
	  <p>
	    Distinctive features of "the sound" of Japanese
	    include <em>very simple syllable
	    structure</em>, <em>relatively few vowels (5)</em>
	    and <em>contrasts between long and short vowels</em>.
	    Japanese has more different sounds than
	    say... Hawaiian. But it has less than the Indo-European
	    languages. Many people find this <b>euphonic</b> ("good
	    sounding"). Most Japanese words can be readily pronounced
	    intelligibly ("so that it can be understood") by native
	    English speakers, with only a minute or two of
	    explanation. As such, English has many Japanese loan words
	    (compare this to harder-to-pronounce languages like
	    Russian, Chinese, or Vietnamese). 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Providing some details on some of these words you are
	    probably already familiar with can illuminate various
	    aspects of how Japanese sounds:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <i>sushi</i>&mdash;English speakers will pronounce the
	      'u' different than Japanese speakers, but it will still
	      be understandable
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <i>tsunami</i>&mdash;English speakers often pronounce
	      the 'ts' as just a 's'; this is a harder one
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <i>Tokyo</i>&mdash;English speakers won't pronounce the
	      'o's in this word as "long" (duration)
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <i>samurai</i>&mdash;The Japanese 'r' sounds more like
	      the middle <b>flap</b> sound in <i>butter</i> (American
	      English pronunciation) than the 'r's in <i>railroad</i>.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <i>Zen</i>&mdash; ...
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Speakers of English will be able recognize many words in
	    spoken Japanese, particularly in settings that require
	    lots of these "loan" words. In Anime, you get a lot
	    of these sorts of words (Japanese people using foreign
	    borrowings to make stuff that sounds cool to them).
	  </p>

	  <h3>Grammar</h3>
	  <p>
	    In many ways, Japanese grammar is easier to learn than
	    that of European languages, including English. Japanese
	    has far less "irregular verbs" than English and its
	    conjugation rules are fairly straight forward. Japanese
	    grammar is well-studied and ample resources exist to get
	    more details if you need them.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    One area where Japanese Grammar reflects Japanese society
	    is in its use of many different politeness/formality
	    levels. There are discrete levels reflected in verb
	    conjugations and word choice, with no analog in English as
	    I know it. In some European languages, this might be
	    comparable to different forms of "you"
	    (e.g. Spanish <i>tú</i> vs <i>ustéd</i>).
	  </p>

	  <h2>Written Japanese</h2>
	  <p>
	    Written Japanese looks really cool but it is ridiculously
	    complicated. Japanese uses at least four different scripts:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><i>Kanji</i> (Chinese characters)</li>
	    <li><i>Hiragana</i> (Japanese <i>kana</i>)</li>
	    <li><i>Katakana</i> (Japanese <i>kana</i>)</li>
	    <li><i>Rômazi</i> (Latin characters)</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    In Japanese-language materials targed at
	    learners&mdash;such as materials for school children or
	    relatively advanced learners&mdash; content is often
	    sorted by a fixed ordering of <i>kana</i>. When learning
	    Japanese, you will likely be exposed to this ordering,
	    which is based off <b>syllable</b> rather than initial
	    "letter/sound". So the ordering beings: <i>a, i, u, e, o;
	    ka, ki, ku, ke, ko...</i>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Various systems exist for the <b>Romanization</b> of
	    Japanese&mdash;writing Japanese in the Latin ("English")
	    alphabet. You are most likely to
	    encounter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization">Hepburn
	    romanization</a>.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Differences Between Written and Spoken Japanese</h3>
	  <p>
	    Many literary words you will rarely hear spoken (similar
	    with other languages?).

	  <h2>Links and Resources</h2>
	  <p>Resources for learning to use Japanese are plentiful...</p>
	  <h3>External Resources</h3>
	  <p>
	    Books/print resources; not free, but can often be acquired
	    very inexpensively secondhand. Many high-quality online
	    resources exist.
