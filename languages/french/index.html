        <h2>My Experience With French</h2>
        <p>
          I learned basic pronunciation of French words
          because they kept popping up all over the place in
          stuff I was reading.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Learning French</h2>
        <p>
          I would argue that learning French will probably
          be <em>the easiest</em> foregin language for a
          speaker of English. If you dont' get lost in the
          minutae of grammar and just consoom lots of French
          (audio, reading) I think you can very quickly gain
          a passive understanding of French. Combined with
          some more in-depth study, you should be able to
          write enough French to debate people over the
          Internet.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="mb-4">Easy Stuff</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Plentiful
            resources&mdash;including
            rich lexical resources
          </li>
          <li>
            The orthography is <em>not even that bad</em>.
            Don't listen to butt-hurt people talk about
            how French spelling is "illogical". Once you
            know a handful of rules, there is a pretty
            1-to-1 mapping from written language to spoken
            language which means you will be able to
            pronounce unfamiliar words with ease.
          </li>
          <li>
            Widely spoken language with many native
            speakers as well as enthusiastic second
            language learners.
          </li>
          <li>
            A rich literary history with lots of things
            freely available in public domain
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          For English speakers, I suggest using the United
          States International keyboard layout with French.
          You can also use this keyboard to type other
          languages, such as German. You don't need to buy a
          fancy new keyboard with more buttons or anything.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="mb-4">Hard Stuff</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pronouncing and distinguishing all the different
            vowels of French can be challenging at first.
            French has many more vowels than languages like
            Spanish or Japanese (these both only have 5).
          </li>
          <li>
            Difficult to learn local expressions
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Should I learn French?</h2>
        <p>
          To quickly enjoy the benefits of
          learning <em>some</em> foreign language, French is
          an excellent choice for English speakers. It will be
          familiar enough that you can achieve enough
          proficiency to read texts and look up words you
          don't know without much difficulty. It will help you
          understand English better (many words come from
          French).
