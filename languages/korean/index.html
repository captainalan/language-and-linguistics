	  <h1>Korean</h1>
	  <p>
	    Over the past decade or so, the popularity of the Korean
	    language has skyrocketed as a new species
	    of <b>Consoomer</b> has spawned, even more terrible than
	    <b>weaboos</b> (AKA weebs, fans of Japanese
	    stuff). The <b>Koreaboo</b> subsists off a diet of drama,
	    mass produced drum beats, and powerful vocals.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I became interested in Korean before it became super
	    popular, similar to how you probably decided on your
	    favorite indie rock bands. For me, it started with
	    learning the Korean
	    alphabet, <i>hangul</i> <span class="ko-text">한글</span>,
	    it evolved into reading the
	    Bible <span class="ko-text">성경</span> in Korean, and
	    then it metasticized into diving into the Korean internet.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Nobody ever asked me to learn Korean, so I suppose most of
	    my Korean learning can be considered a time-draining
	    LARPing exercise. Of all the languages that I've studied,
	    Korean has the fewest native speakers (though a much more
	    "online" population comparably). The Korean language is
	    associated with a particular ethnicity (Korean) of which I
	    have no known connection (genetically). Contrast this
	    state of affairs with learning a language like Spanish,
	    Russian, or even Arabic&mdash;someone or some institution
	    might ask you to learn one of these languages even if you
	    lack any ethnic connection with them as they are practical
	    languages for things like business, religion, etc.

	  <h2>Crop Circle Conspiracy Theories</h2>
	  <p>
	    Searching for information on <i>hangul</i>, the Korean
	    writing system, you are bound to come across all sorts of
	    click bait about how Korean writing is somehow
	    "scientific".  Let me spell out plainly what is cool about
	    Korean writing and what is not.
	  </p>

	  <div class="caption">Hypothesized origins of the Korean Writing System</div>

	  <p>
	    The Korean writing system largely corresponds to
	    Korean <b>phonology</b>, meaning how speakers think of
	    their language. Note that there is something of a "chicken
	    and egg" problem here&mdash;is it that Korean speakers
	    analyze their language in a particular way because
	    of <i>hangul</i> or was <i>hangul</i> designed to match
	    speaker intuitions? In any case, <i>hangul</i> orthography
	    ("spelling system") is relatively consistent and the
	    pronunciations of words are more-or-less readily derivable
	    from how they are spelled (some nerds will tell you Korean
	    is <b>tonal</b>, similar to Japanese, and that this
	    information is not represented in the orthography).
	  </p>

	  <h2 class="mt-4">Technology</h2>
	  <p>
	    Despite having a fairly complex script (requireds
	    composition, vertical and horizontal combinations), Korean
	    is a fairly well-supported language technologically. It
	    probably helps that big companies like Samsung (삼성) are
	    Korean so they can provide support...
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Many Korean technologies are natively created (e.g. Hangul
	    keyboards) rather than directly copying Western tech...
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In broad strokes, Korean technologies are "more American
	    than Japanese".
	  </p>

	  <h3>One of the Bestest Languages Ever to Type</h3>
	  <p>
	    See my article on (computer, phone) <a href="input.html">
	    input methods</a> in Korean.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
	  <p>
	    The words of Korean can be broken up into a few pretty
	    well defined categories.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Native Korean Vocabulary</h3>
	  <p>
	    Native Korean words make use of more complex sound
	    patterns than the vocabulary borrowed from Japan and China
	    (see "The Cursed Sino-Korean Lexicon" below).
	  </p>

	  <h3>The Cursed Sino-Korean Lexicon</h3>
	  <p>
	    Many words borrowed from Chinese characters entered Korean
	    through the <a href="../japanese/index.html">Japanese</a> language
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    If you are already familiar with Japanese or Chinese,
	    learning Korean vocabulary will be a lot easier. Shared
	    Chinese roots is like shared Latin/Greek roots across the
	    European languages. Knowing English is also helpful for
	    learning Korean because many words are borrowed from
	    English and Korean media often features English (much less
	    so in North Korea, of course).
	  </p>

	  <h3>English, other foreign borrowings</h3>

	    a pretty unique place)
