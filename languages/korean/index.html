	  <h1>Korean</h1>
	  <p>
	    Over the past decade or so, the popularity of the Korean
	    language has skyrocketed as a new species
	    of <b>Consoomer</b> has spawned, even more terrible than
	    <b>weaboos</b> (AKA weebs, fans of Japanese
	    stuff). The <b>Koreaboo</b> subsists off a diet of drama,
	    mass produced drum beats, and powerful vocals.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I became interested in Korean before it became super
	    popular, similar to how you probably decided on your
	    favorite indie rock bands. For me, it started with
	    learning the Korean
	    alphabet, <i>hangul</i> <span class="ko-text">한글</span>,
	    it evolved into reading the
	    Bible <span class="ko-text">성경</span> in Korean, and
	    then it metasticized into diving into the Korean internet.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Crop Circle Conspiracy Theories</h2>
	  <p>
	    Searching for information on <i>hangul</i>, the Korean
	    writing system, you are bound to come across all sorts of
	    click bait about how Korean writing is somehow
	    "scientific".  Let me spell out plainly what is cool about
	    Korean writing and what is not.
	  </p>

	  <div class="caption">Hypothesized origins of the Korean Writing System</div>

	  <p>
	    The Korean writing system largely corresponds to
	    Korean <b>phonology</b>, meaning how speakers think of
	    their language. Note that there is something of a "chicken
	    and egg" problem here&mdash;is it that Korean speakers
	    analyze their language in a particular way because
	    of <i>hangul</i> or was <i>hangul</i> designed to match
	    speaker intuitions? In any case, <i>hangul</i> orthography
	    ("spelling system") is relatively consistent and the
	    pronunciations of words are more-or-less readily derivable
	    from how they are spelled (some nerds will tell you Korean
	    is <b>tonal</b>, similar to Japanese, and that this
	    information is not represented in the orthography).

	  <h2>Technology</h2>
	  <h3>The Bestest Language Ever to Type</h3>
	  <p>
	    See my article on (computer, phone) <a href="input.html">
	    input methods</a> in Korean.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
	  <p>
	    The words of Korean can be broken up into a few pretty
	    well defined categories.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Native Korean Vocabulary</h3>
	  <h3>The Cursed Sino-Korean Lexicon</h3>
	  <p>
	    Many words borrowed from Chinese characters entered Korean
	    through the <a href="../japanese/index.html">Japanese</a> language
	  </p>
	  <h3>English, other foreign borrowings</h3>

	  <h2>Grammar</h2>

	    a pretty unique place)
