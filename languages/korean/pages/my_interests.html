					By <a href="https://captainalan.github.io">Alan W</a> &mdash;
					Last updated December 16, 2020
				</div>

				<p>
					Korean was the first foreign language I studied without ever taking a
					class and the second foreign language I studied with some intensity after
					Spanish. I grew up in an area with many 1st and 2nd generation overseas
					Korean people (<span lang="ko">교포</span>). My exposure to Korean was thus often sporadic&mdash;
					I knew many people that spoke some Korean but many didn't feel comfortable
					reading or writing, let alone getting into the intricacies of grammar.
					Thus, my early entry into Korean was <em>learning a lot of words</em> and
					being able to understand a good deal, but I lacked in ability to string together
					sentences aside from relatively formal sounding textbook sentences, e.g. using
					the <span lang="ko">-(스)ㅂ니다</span> verbal ending.
				</p>
				<p>
					I became interested in Korean before it became super
					popular, similar to how you probably decided on your
					favorite indie rock bands. For me, it started with
					learning the Korean
					alphabet, <i>hangul</i> <span lang="ko">한글</span>,
					it evolved into reading the
					Bible (<span lang="ko">성경</span>) in Korean, and
					then it metasticized into diving into the Korean internet.
					At the time I'm writing this (December 2020), my interest
					in learning Korean is mostly sustained by <em>momentum</em>&mdash;continuing
					something I've started, rather than having any pressing
					questions to investigate or things to do with it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nobody ever asked me to learn Korean, so I suppose most of
					my Korean learning can be considered a time-draining
					<a
						href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=live%20action%20role%20play"><b>LARP</b></a>ing
					exercise. Of all the languages that I've studied, Korean
					has the fewest native speakers. The Korean language is
					associated with a particular ethnicity (Korean) of which I
					have no known connection (genetically). Contrast this
					state of affairs with learning a language like <a href="../../spanish/index.html">Spanish</a>,
					<a href="../../russian/index.html">Russian</a>, or even
					Arabic&mdash;someone or some institution might ask you to
					learn one of these languages even if you lack any ethnic
					connection with them as they are practical languages for
					things like business, religion, etc. Korean is not significant
					like Latin, Russian, or Spanish as <em>a language of empire</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, for my personal history and my place in the world, Korean
					does occupy a special place.
				</p>

				<h2>Korean, Culture, and the Crumble of Western Civilization</h2>
				<p>
					Studying Korean was my first journey away from the "default" culture
					I was born and raised into. Growing up only speaking English, I was
					largely "colorblind" to the differences of Korean, Chinese, Taiwanese,
					Hong Kong, and so forth. There was <i>Asian stuff</i> which was foreign
					to me, and I knew I belonged to Chinese stock. How exactly that differed
					from the places peers around me came from was unclear.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was from Koreans that I learned <em>Korea is not China</em> (Taiwanese
					friends also echoed a similar point). I saw what might be called "nationalism"
					for the first time&mdash;watching events like the World Cup or the Olympics,
					Korean friends would cheer for Korea&mdash;the people representing Korea
					would look similar (ethnically) so the physical connection was obvious.
					Korean-Americans seemed to really enjoy an "American plus one" identity&mdash;
					enjoying all the (legal) benefits of being American but then also being
					able to flip to a Korean identity as convenient.
				</p>

				<h3>K-popium for the masses</h3>
				<p>
					Over the past decade or so, the popularity of the Korean
					language has skyrocketed as a new species
					of <b>Consoomer</b> has spawned, even more terrible than
					<b>weaboos</b> (AKA weebs, fans of Japanese
					stuff). The <b>Koreaboo</b> subsists off a diet of drama,
					mass produced drum beats, and powerful vocals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reasons for studying Korean differ for every individual of
					course. However, I think it would be a disservice to the
					reader to <em>not</em> mention some important
					generalizations about who learns Korean and why. Here
					goes: <em>people are attracted to the aesthetics of
						Korea</em>&mdash;that is, they think Korean people, Korean
					stuff, Korean food, is pretty.
				</p>
				<p>
					Compared to much of the stuff pushed in the West, the
					people and products of Korea have a very... standard
					appeal. Go vegan or planet earth dies? Fak that, how about
					some <b>kimchi</b> stew (with meat). Mumble rap? How about
					some nice sounding ballad showcasing <em>singing</em>
					rather that some probably drug-influenced rhythmic
					talking. Diversity? Korea is practically an ethno-state,
					and I think many people living in cosmopolitan Western
					cities are rather jealous of that (the less other
					foreigners they see while visiting Korea, the happier they
					are&mdash;secretly).
				</p>
				<p>
					While Japanese anime is often associated with nerds, Korean
					mass entertainment has been designed to target a wide lowest common
					denominator&mdash;not just cartoon watching oversized children.
					Your mom might buy Korean cosmetics. You might follow a handful of
					<em>idols</em>. Your colleagues at work might discuss the plot of
					some drama and who their favorite actors/actresses are. It is like
					the mass entertainment of the West, but with prettier faces and
					often with less overt occult/evil influences.
				</p>

				<h3>Theatre States</h3>
				<p>
					You may have heard North Korea called a "theatre state" wherein
					performances are put on for foreign visitors to make life there
					appear much nicer than how it typically is&mdash;rather than people
					starving under a Godless authority, you are presented with smiling
					people living in an orderly society...
					In many Western minds, <em>South</em> Korea occupies a similar position.
					Particularly for those in <b>ethno-nationalist</b> crowds, South Korea
					is held up as a homogenous state full of beautiful people. <em>If only
						the West could return to that ideal</em>, say the
					<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually"><i>ackshual</i></a>
					racists.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus both Koreas stand as a kind of symbol of what a society of
					relatively homogenous people could look like in the twenty-first century&mdash;a
					time when the historical identity of many nations have eroded under agendas
					of <b>globalization</b>.
				</p>

				<h2>Hyper-literate Technocracy</h2>
				<p>
					South Korea has emerged as a strange kind of hyper-urban,
					hyper-connected cyberpunk place&mdash;especial in big cities
					like Seoul. The products of a handful of major corporations
					(<span lang="ko">재벌</span>) are ubiquitous. There is faster Internet and smaller
					apartments, compared with most of the United States.
					There is mass literacy&mdash;we can probably give some credit
					to the <span lang="ko">hangul 한글</span> alphabet for helping in this.
