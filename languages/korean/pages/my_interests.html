	  <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
	  <p>(Content below is less of general interest)</p>
	  <h3>My own journey</h3>
	  <p>
	    I became interested in Korean before it became super
	    popular, similar to how you probably decided on your
	    favorite indie rock bands. For me, it started with
	    learning the Korean
	    alphabet, <i>hangul</i> <span class="ko-text">한글</span>,
	    it evolved into reading the
	    Bible (<span class="ko-text">성경</span>) in Korean, and
	    then it metasticized into diving into the Korean internet.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Nobody ever asked me to learn Korean, so I suppose most of
	    my Korean learning can be considered a time-draining
	    <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=live%20action%20role%20play">LARP</a>ing
	    exercise. Of all the languages that I've studied, Korean
	    has the fewest native speakers (though a much more
	    "online" population comparably). The Korean language is
	    associated with a particular ethnicity (Korean) of which I
	    have no known connection (genetically). Contrast this
	    state of affairs with learning a language like <a href="../spanish/index.html">Spanish</a>,
	    <a href="../russian/index.html">Russian</a>, or even
	    Arabic&mdash;someone or some institution might ask you to
	    learn one of these languages even if you lack any ethnic
	    connection with them as they are practical languages for
	    things like business, religion, etc.
	  </p>
	
	  <h3>Korean, Culture, and the Crumble of Western Civilization</h3>
	  <p>
	    Over the past decade or so, the popularity of the Korean
	    language has skyrocketed as a new species
	    of <b>Consoomer</b> has spawned, even more terrible than
	    <b>weaboos</b> (AKA weebs, fans of Japanese
	    stuff). The <b>Koreaboo</b> subsists off a diet of drama,
	    mass produced drum beats, and powerful vocals.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Reasons for studying Korean differ for every individual of
	    course. However, I think it would be a disservice to the
	    reader to <em>not</em> mention some important
	    generalizations about who learns Korean and why. Here
	    goes: <em>people are attracted to the aesthetics of
	    Korea</em>&mdash;that is, they think Korean people, Korean
	    stuff, Korean food, is pretty.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Compared to much of the stuff pushed in the West, the
	    people and products of Korea have a very... standard
	    appeal. Go vegan or planet earth dies? Fak that, how about
	    some <b>kimchi</b> stew (with meat). Mumble rap? How about
	    some nice sounding ballad showcasing <em>singing</em>
	    rather that some probably drug-influenced rhythmic
	    talking. Diversity? Korea is practically an ethno-state,
	    and I think many people living in cosmopolitan Western
	    cities are rather jealous of that (the less other
	    foreigners they see while visiting Korea, the happier they
	    are&mdash;secretly).

	  <h3>The Hermit Kingdom</h3>
	  (About North Korea)

	  <h3>Korea and China</h3>
	  (Culturally distinct for quite a while)

	  <h3>The Korean Intranets</h3>
	  <p>
	    (Intrigue about how the Korean language Internet space is
	    a pretty unique place)
	  </p>
		  <p>
	    Despite having a fairly complex script (requireds
	    composition, vertical and horizontal combinations), Korean
	    is a fairly well-supported language technologically. It
	    probably helps that big companies like Samsung (삼성) are
	    Korean so they can provide support...
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Many Korean technologies are natively created (e.g. Hangul
	    keyboards) rather than directly copying Western tech...
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In broad strokes, Korean technologies are "more American
	    than Japanese".
	  </p>

	  <h2>Links, Resources, etc.</h2>
	  <p>
	    Except for conventionalized spellings
	    (e.g. <i>hangul</i>), I have made use of Yale Romanization
	    throughout this article.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    See my article on (computer, phone) <a href="input.html">
	    input methods</a> in Korean. Overall, I think computer
	    input methods for Korean are very good.
