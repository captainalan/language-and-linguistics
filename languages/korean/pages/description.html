          What follows is an opinionated&mdash;as well as
          descriptively accurate (to the best of my
          ability)&mdash;description of the Korean language.
          <em>The</em> Korean language?! What about muh dialects?
          No, I mean <em>the</em> Korean language as standardized in
          textbooks, broadcasted as video, taught in schools, and
          spoken by nice (<span lang="ko">착한</span>)
          city people. That's what I've mainly been exposed to and what you will
          most likely encounter in classes and learning materials, so
          that is what will be discussed here.

        <p>
          The <b>Korean peninsula</b> sticks out of China (view a <a
            href="https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/east_asia_pol_95.jpg">political map</a>).
          South
          Korea is like an "island" because
          one does not simply travel through North Korea&mdash;while South Korea has many large airports with frequent
          flights to and from the Western world at large, travel to and from North Korea is strictly controlled.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Koreas occupy an interesting position on the 21st century geopolitical stage.
          From an American perspective, the Koreas neighbor two major world powers&mdash;China and Russia.
          South Korea is the land of K-pop and K-drama, mass entertainment pumped through
          Southern California to the world at large&mdash;and engine for selling cosmetics, clothing, and more.
          North Korea is a land shrouded in mystery, often used as a foil to the <em>free</em> Western world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In South Korea, there is a lot of English study&mdash;visiting Korean websites for
          language-related topics, you will definitely run into lots of ads for English-learning
          products and services. To a lesser extent, you may run into Chinese and Japanese materials.
          Interest in studying older Korean things often means going back to <em>classical Chinese</em>.
          Studying this for a Korean is comparable to studying Greek/Latin for an English speaker&mdash;it
          probably will sound kind of esoteric or academic to most people.

        <h2 class="text-center">Vocabulary</h2>
        <p>
          The words of Korean can be broken up into a few pretty
          well defined categories. Just like English primarily draws on Latinate vocabulary (often
          through French) with smaller numbers of words from Greek, Germanic, and other origins, the
          vocabulary of Korean comes mainly from a few sources. In recent times, North and South Korean
          speech (according to available sources) separates more and more, with South Korean absorbing
          more vocabulary from the USA/West and North Korea going its own way.

        <h3>Native Korean Vocabulary</h3>
        <p>
          Native Korean words make use of more complex sound
          patterns than the vocabulary borrowed from Japan and China
          (see "The Sino-Korean Lexicon" below). Some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span lang="ko" class="highlighted">닭 talk</span>
            "chicken"&mdash;the final "l" is sometimes
            pronounced, sometimes not, depending how this word is
            used (the <b>phonetic environment</b> of the word).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span lang="ko" class="highlighted">깨닫다 kkaytat-ta</span>
            "understand"&mdash;this word makes use of a
            Korean <em>stressed</em> consonant sound 'kk'; can be
            very tricky to hear and pronounce for second language learners.
            This is different from doubled-consonants in languages
            like Latin and Italian!
          </li>
          <li>
            <span lang="ko" class="highlighted">좋다 coh-ta</span>
            "good"&mdash;this word belongs to a class of adjectives,
            which kinda act like verbs. Only native Korean
            adjectives are members of this (grammatical) class.
            Japanese likewise has native adjectives that act "verb-like".
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many Native Korean vocabulary pertains to common,
          every-day things (e.g. stuff that may appear on
          the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list">Swadesh
            list</a>, used for comparative linguistics).
        </p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption">
            Often, names of foods or cooking techniques are native
            Korean words.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          As in <a href="../japanese/index.html">Japanese</a>, native words are often associated with Chinese characters
          <span lang="ko">한자 (漢字) hanca</span>. For instance, the word for "garlic" in Korean is <span lang="ko">마늘
            manul</span> (native) but it is
          associated with the Chinese character 蒜 which is pronounced <span lang="ko">산 san</span> in Sino-Korean
          compounds. A <a href="https://hanja.dict.naver.com/#/search?query=%EB%A7%88%EB%8A%98">hanja dictionary</a>
          will have this information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many native Korean words are <b>multi-syllabic</b>&mdash;often they are longer than single-syllable Chinese
          <b>morphemes</b>, which are often compounded into <b>bimorphemic</b> words.
        </p>

      </article>
      <article class="col-md-6">

        <h3>The Sino-Korean Lexicon</h3>
        <p>
          Many words borrowed
          from <a href="../chinese/characters.html">Chinese
            characters</a> entered Korean through
          the <a href="../japanese/index.html">Japanese</a>
          language. In broad strokes, this is because Japan had a
          nationalization movement and chose to adapt Western
          technology first among the (modern) East Asian nations.
          Thus Japan got a lots of widespread Western learning
          first. Korea and China, already in the "Sinosphere" of
          cultural influence (which I define by using a lot of
          Chinese characters), borrowed many words from Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
          By count, these words make up the bulk of the Korean
          lexicon as they are used for many names of things
          (abstract, concrete) and actions. Whereas native Korean
          words are used as the "grammatical glue" bringing the
          Korean language together, the Sino-Korean lexicon is built
          off a repository of <b>morphemes</b> (Chinese characters)
          that get glued together in near endless combinations. Some
          examples (periods separate pronunciations of characters):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span lang="ko" class="highlighted">학생 (學生) hak.sayng</span> "student"
          </li>
          <li>
            <span lang="ko" class="highlighted">학교 (學校) hak.kyo</span> "school"
          </li>
          <li>
            <span lang="ko" class="highlighted">학급 (學級) hak.kup</span> "class level" (e.g. 5th grade)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Policy has oscillated in both South and North Korea with
          respect to the whether or not Chinese characters are used
          and taught. In the South, they are used less and less
          except maybe in certain academic circles. The North has
          all-but banished them from public life, I believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Note: </b> If you are already familiar with Japanese or
          Chinese, learning Korean vocabulary will be a lot easier.
          Shared Chinese roots is like shared Latin/Greek roots
          across the European languages. Knowing English is also
          helpful for learning Korean because many words are
          borrowed from English and Korean media often features
          English (much less so in North Korea, of course).
        </p>

        <h3>English, other foreign borrowings</h3>
        <p>
          The language of South Korea has much more English
          influence, compared with North Korea. When new words,
          there is sometimes confusion about <b>transliteration</b>
          (representing a word in a new script)&mdash;this is also a
          problem in Japanese, where multiple variants of spelling
          may exist for some English word. Some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span lang="ko" class="highlighted">코로나바이러스 kholona-bairesu</span> "Coronavirus"
          </li>
          <li>
            <span lang="ko" class="highlighted">프로그램 phulogulaym</span> "Progam"
          </li>
          <li>
            <span lang="ko" class="highlighted">마스크 masukhu</span> "Mask"
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I hear that North Korea has some borrowings from Russia
          (Soviet connection). I'll add some of those examples if I
          find them.

          Here, I describe the grammar of Korean in terms of
          ("traditional") linguistic divisions.

        <h3>Phonology</h3>
        <p>
          Compared with European languages like English, Korean only
          allows relatively simple syllable structure, usually of
          the form CV(C)&mdash;a consonant followed by a vowel with
          an optional final consonant. Korean has more vowels than
          Spanish (5), but less than English (10+?). Korean doesn't
          have any super prominent features, like French's nasal
          vowels everywhere or
          Russian's <a
            href="https://therussianblog.wordpress.com/2012/02/18/palatalization-in-russian/">palatalization</a>
          phenomena. In this sense, it is a very "normal" sounding
          language. South Korean (Seoul) intonation has been
          described as sounding like complaining in English.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may have heard that you can "learn to read" Korean
          very quickly. This is kinda true in the sense that there
          is a relatively direct mapping between the way words are
          written and how they are pronounced. However there are
          many "rules" governing how different combinations of
          letters are pronounced.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, many sounds are "nasalized" when next to
          nasal sounds like 'n', 'm', and 'ng' (linguists call this
          "<b>nasal assimilation</b>"). The word
          <span lang="ko">한국말 hankwuk-mal</span> "Korean
          speech" is pronounced more
          like <span lang="ko">한궁말 hankwung-mal</span>,
          with the final 'k' in <span lang="ko">한국
            hankwuk</span> "Korea" becoming like 'ng' because it is next
          to an 'm'.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparable processes exist in all languages. For instance,
          in French there
          is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_%28French%29>"><i>liaison</i></a>
          which leads words to be pronounced differently depending
          where they appear in sentences. With Korean, it is exactly
          like this, only the specifics of these processes are
          different and Korean draws from a different set of "base"
          sound categories. Learning to read any other language,
          even if they use some variety of the Latin alphabet as
          English does, will involve learning new rules for pronouncing
          letters and combinations of letters. In this sense, I think
          that the "easiness" of learning to read Korean is greatly exaggerated
          though certain Korean writing looks "very foreign" and is easier
          to learn to read than languages like Arabic (which doesn't mark
          short vowels), Chinese/Japanese (needs no explanation), or an
          Indic language which will have many more complex consonant
          combinations.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="col-md-6">
        <h3>Morphology</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Morphology</b> is the study of how the form of words
          change (depending where those words are used). Korean
          morphology is much richer for native Korean words compared
          with Sino-Korean or other loan words. Native Korean verbs
          and adjectives conjugate, some irregularly, but all-in-all
          pretty nice to learn compared to
          the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusional_language">fusional</a>
          morphology found in the European languages (among others).
        </p>
        <p>
          The form of Sino-Korean and foreign loan words tend to
          retain the same form wherever they are found, with native
          Korean grammatical elements, such as the
          verb <span lang="ko">하다 ha-ta</span>, doing all the
          heavy grammatical lifting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Korean does something that is kinda like "case marking" in
          languages like German and Russian. <b>Particles</b> are
          affixed to the end of words to indicate how they are used
          in sentences. For example...
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span lang="ko">커피가 있어요. Khephi<b>-ka</b> isseyo.</span> (I) have coffee.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span lang="ko">커피를 마셨어요. Khephi<b>-lul</b> masyesseyo.</span> (I) drank coffee.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span lang="ko">커피로 죽었어요. Khephi<b>-lo</b> cwukesseyo.</span> (I) died by coffee.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Often, these particles can be ommitted. Note, that
          grammarians studying foreign languages often use
          "particle" or other similar not-so-descriptive terms to
          refer to elements that don't readily correspond to stuff
          in Greek or Latin grammar, from which the West inherited
          much of its grammatical traditions.
        </p>

        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Verbs</b> nearly always appear at the end of sentences. The
          word order of Korean will be intuitive to people who have
          studied Japanese, Hindi, or other "object-verb" (OV)
          languages.
        </p>
        <p>
           Note that what is called a "verb" in Korean may be used to express many
           meanings expressed with other grammatical categories in other languages.
           Consider: in English, I can say "the book is red". Here, we have <i>is</i>
           which may be called a verb&mdash;a conjugation of "to be" (more precisely,
           it may be identified as a <b>copula</b>). In Korean, one might say something
           along the lines of "car-TOPIC red" <span lang="ko">자동차는 빨갛다. catongcha-nun ppalkahta.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Korean sentences will often end with some kind of "conjugational endings"
          that involves combining more than one verb. This can be compared to "helper/auxiliary
          verbs" in English&mdash;e.g. "I <i>could have gone</i> to the event".
          In Korean I might say, "Event-to go-FUTURE able was"<span lang="ko">이벤트에 갈 수 있었어요.
          ibenthu-ey kal swu issesseyo.</span>

          As it is often used on the Internet, in books, and other
          modern publications, Korean is very much like English.
          Korean uses white space in its writing and consequently
          people have a fairly robust consensus on what constitutes
          a "word". In the past, Korean was written top to bottom in
          columns, following Chinese tradition. This practice is
          practically entirely abandoned; Korean nearly always
          appears flowing horizontally, left to right.
        </p>

        <h3>Crop Circle Conspiracy Theories</h3>
        <p>
          Searching for information on <i>hangul</i>, the Korean
          writing system, you are bound to come across all sorts of
          click bait about how Korean writing is somehow
          "scientific". Let me spell out plainly what is cool about
          Korean writing and what is not.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Korean writing system largely corresponds to
          Korean <b>phonology</b> (see above if you skipped ahead!),
          meaning how speakers think of their language. Note that
          there is something of a "chicken and egg" problem
          here&mdash;is it that Korean speakers analyze their
          language in a particular way because of <i>hangul</i> or
          was <i>hangul</i> designed to match speaker intuitions? In
          any case, <i>hangul</i> orthography ("spelling system") is
          relatively consistent and the pronunciations of words are
          more-or-less readily derivable from how they are spelled
          (some nerds will tell you Korean is <b>tonal</b>, similar
          to Japanese, and that this information is not represented
          in the orthography).
        </p>
        <p>
          Korean does not have upper and lower-case letters.
          However, modern typographical practices like using
          bolding, italics, and different font faces entirely are
          commonly employed in Korean publications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The further you go back towards the 20th century, the more
          "Japanese-like" conventions you will find. Moving forward
          through the 21st century, Korean is gravitating around
          increasingly American-English like ways of doing writing.
          Translated foreign works are a popular reading genre in
          Korea, especially those from English and Japanese.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that pretty much all South Koreans
          receive English language education over many years of
          schooling. So, while you cannot expect an average South
          Korean to be able to speak English fluently,
          you <em>can</em> expect them to be familiar with the Latin
          alphabet and many English words, especially terms they may
          have seen through imported products (i.e. product names
          that use English words).

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Korean is a language that is typical in many ways from a
          standpoint of linguistic diversity. However, it is
          atypical in that it is a relatively strong, healthy
          language of non-Indo-European origin that makes use of its
          own indigenous script. Studying Korean, you will get the
          view of language that has many of its own home-brewed
          ideas, but also clearly identifiable influences from first
          Japanese/Chinese (the "Sinosphere") and later the West. As
          Korean is a fairly well defined standard, I am curious to
          see how it will fare maintaining its uniqueness as not
          only European languages, but
          also <a href="../chinese/index.html">Chinese</a> continues
          to grow, exerting its influence on East Asia.

          I'll continue writing more
          on <a href="./my_interests.html">my personal experience
            with Korean</a> (complete with cultural/sociological
          musings) in future article(s).

        <h2>End Notes</h2>
        <p>
          Except for conventionalized spellings
          (e.g. <i>hangul</i>), I have made use of Yale Romanization
          throughout this article. Academics sometimes use this
          system. For learning Korean, it is highly recommended you
          learn the Korean alphabet. Get a <b>phrasebook</b> and
          listen to some sentences read off YouTube to get started.
        </p>
        <p>
          See my article on (computer, phone) <a href="input.html">
            input methods</a> in Korean. Overall, I think computer
          input methods for Korean are very good.
