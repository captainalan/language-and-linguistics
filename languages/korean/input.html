	  <h1>Korean Input Methods</h1>
	  <h2><span class="ko-text">한국어 입력법</span></h2>

	  <p>By <a href="https://captainalan.github.io">Alan W</a> &mdash; December 28, 2019</p>
	  <p>
	    This page offers a descriptive account of Korean language
	    input methods to English speaking audiences. This page is
	    written for people interested in keyboard layouts, broadly
	    and focuses on the design and ergonomics of Korean
	    keyboard layouts rather than history or the Korean
	    language.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I make use
	    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_romanization_of_Korean">Yale
	    Romanization</a> for Korean (in addition to
	    giving <span class="ko-text">한글 hankul</span> because it
	    more-or-less corresponds to written Korean. This
	    Romanization system is useful for discussing keyboards
	    because it reflects equivalents of the <i>letters</i> that
	    Korean speakers would type. It is less intuitive and
	    requires some extra practice to pronounce correctly for
	    English speakers; however, since learning Korean isn't the
	    focus of this article I leave this as <em>an exercise to
	    the reader</em>. All uses of Yale Romanization will be
	    typeset specially so it is easy to tell when a
	    linguistically-motivated spelling is used for illustrative
	    purposes and when conventional spellings are used to make
	    searching for more information easier.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Korean Language and Orthography</h2>
	  <p>
	    In order to understand Korean keyboard layouts, a grasp of
	    at least a few aspects of the Korean language and Korean
	    orthography are necessary. Here I present a brief account
	    that should be sufficient for understanding keyboard
	    matters.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Speech</h3>
	  <p>
	    Korean, as a spoken language, allows for syllables of the
	    form <code>(C)V(C)</code>, where <code>C</code> represents
	    a consonant and <code>V</code> represents a vowel.
	    Below are some examples of Korean words:
	  </p>

	  <ul>
	    <li><span class="ko-text">사람 salam</span> person</li>
	    <li><span class="ko-text">한국 hankwuk</span> Korea</li>
	    <li><span class="ko-text">자판 caphan</span> keyboard</li>
	    <li><span class="ko-text">진짜 cincca</span> really</li>
	    <li><span class="ko-text">감사합니다 kamsahapnita</span> thank you (formal)</li>
	    <li><span class="ko-text">화학 hwahak</span> chemistry</li>
	    <li><span class="ko-text">위에 wi-ey</span> on top of</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>
	    A few relevant things to note are:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Korean sometimes has doubled consonants, e.g. 'cc' in <span class="ko-text">진짜 cincca</span>.</li>
	    <li>
	      Korean doesn't make use of especially complex consonant clusters
	      (like German <i>Schz...</i> or English <i>st, sh, sch...</i>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Vowel-consonant alternations are frequent, though vowels
	      and consonants both may appear in sequence (linguist
	      lingo <b>diphthongs</b>, <b>consonant clusters</b>
	      respectively)
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  <h3>Syllabic Blocks</h3>

	  <p>
	    Unlike in Latin (as well as Cyrillic, Greek, ...) based
	    writing writing systems, Korean writing is organized
	    into <b>syllabic</b> blocks rather than <b>linearly</b>.
	    In linear systems, like the standard spelling of American
	    English, characters appear one after the other in a 1
	    dimensional line. Syllabic blocks are two dimensional
	    rather than one dimensional, albeit in a constrained way.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Let's look at a couple syllabic blocks. Below, I insert
	    periods (.) between syllabic blocks.  The
	    word <span class="ko-text">학교 hak.kyo</span> "school" is
	    composed of two syllabic blocks: <span class="ko-text">학
	    hak</span> and <span class="ko-text">교 kyo</span>.  The
	    first block, <span class="ko-text">학 hak</span>, consists
	    of three letters <span class="ko-text">ㅎ ㅏ ㄱ h a
	    k</span> which are then combined according to some
	    consistent rules (out of the scope of this article). The
	    second syllable, <span class="ko-text">교 kyo</span>, is
	    composed of two letters, <span class="ko-text">ㄱ ㅛ k
	    yo</span>.
	  </p>
<pre>
h a     k
k       yo
"school"
</pre>
	  <p>
	    The pronunciation of Hangul takes some getting used to
	    because there are a number of <b>assimilation</b> rules
	    (sound segments next to each other affecting how letters
	    are read). Similarly, there are rules governing how
	    adjacent syllable blocks affect one another, similar to
	    French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_%28French%29"><i>liason</i></a>,
	    e.g. wherein the 's' segments in <i>Nous avons...</i> "we
	    have" are pronounced or not depending on what words follow
	    them.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    For more information, read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul">Hangul</a>.
	  </p>

	  <h3>No Upper/Lower Case</h3>
	  <p>
	    Korean does not distinguish upper and lowercase
	    letters. This permits the SHIFT key to be used to activate
	    another "input layer" to input additional characters,
	    similar to how holding down ALT on some keyboard layouts
	    is used to input characters not available on the "default"
	    layer.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Laptops & Desktop Computers</h2>

	  <h3>Two-set layout (2-beolsik)</h3>
	  <p>
	    By far, the most popular Korean keyboard layout is
	    <b>2-beolsik</b> <span class="ko-text">두벌식
	    twu-belsik</span>. Other spellings include 2-bulshik,
	    2-beolshik, and Dubeolsik. This layout is also known as
	    the "two-set" layout in English.
	  </p>
	  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ko/f/fb/2set.png" class="img-fluid" alt="2 set layout">
	  <div class="caption"><p>Image source: <a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%95%9C%EA%B8%80_%EC%9E%90%ED%8C%90#/media/%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%BC:2set.png">Wikipedia (Korean)</a></p></div>
	  <p>
	    In this layout, the keyboard is divided into two "sets"
	    (hence the name) which roughly correspond to consonants
	    and vowels, similar to the Dvorak keyboard layout for
	    English. Vowels are on the right and consonants are on the left.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    As can be seen in the QWERTY row in the diagram above, 
	    the SHIFT key is used for entering doubled consonants and
	    some
	    (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diphthong">diphthong</a>)
	    vowels. For letters that are not able to be doubled,
	    pressing SHIFT typically doesn't do anything.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
	  <p>
	    Due to the nature of the Korean language, the
	    consonant-vowel alternation with consonants mainly on the
	    left hand and vowels mainly on the right hand lead
	    2-beolsik typing to have a lot more left hand, relative to
	    right hand, activity.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Furthermore, the (strong) index fingers aren't doing
	    nearly as much work as they could be doing.
	  </p>

	  <img class="img-fluid" src="./images/2set_heatmap.png" alt="2 Set Layout Heat Map">
	  <div class="caption"><p>Image source: <a href="https://xn--pk3bl9feqb.kr/">세벌식.kr</a></p></div>

	  <p>
	    Nonetheless, the 2-beolsik layout is a good default for
	    many reasons. The consonant/vowel division is
	    intuitive. Pressing SHIFT to double consonants and modify
	    vowels is intuitive. The layout does not demand much
	    stretching to far away keys. Additionally, it makes good
	    use of the home row.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Three-set layouts (3-beolsik)</h3>
	  <p>
	    "Three-set" layouts are called as they are because they
	    divide the keyboard into three sections corresponding to
	    different parts of a syllabic block. These are,
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li><b>Initial Sounds</b> <span class="ko-text">첫소리 ches-soli</span></li>
	    <li><b>Middle Sounds</b><span class="ko-text">가운뎃 소리 kawundeys-soli</span></li>
	    <li><b>Final Sounds</b><span class="ko-text">끝소리 kkuth-soli</span></li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    There are many three-set layouts; here I will focus on the
	    3-beolsik 390 because this is the next most popular Korean
	    keyboard layout after the 2-beolsik. Here's the layout:
	  </p>

	  <img class="img-fluid" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/%EA%B3%B5%EB%B3%91%EC%9A%B0_%EC%9E%90%ED%8C%90%EC%9D%98_%EC%A7%9C%EC%9E%84%EC%83%88.png" alt="3-beolsik Layout">
	  <div class="caption"><p>Image source: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/%EA%B3%B5%EB%B3%91%EC%9A%B0_%EC%9E%90%ED%8C%90%EC%9D%98_%EC%A7%9C%EC%9E%84%EC%83%88.png">Wikipedia (Korean)</a></p></div>

	  <p>
	    Looking at the groups from right to left we have
	    the <b>Initial Sounds</b> (Green), <b>Middle Sounds</b>
	    (Beige) and <b>Final Sounds</b> (Pink). The way this
	    layout works is by a kind of
	    "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio">arpeggiated
	    chord</a>" action. Typing a syllable is initiated with the
	    right hand selecting an initial sound, followed by the
	    left index or middle finger selecting a middle sound
	    (vowel) and then the left middle, ring, or little finger
	    selecting a final sound (which is often not required).
	    Both hands are thus coordinated together in a sort of
	    rolling action.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    If you look closely, you may notice that some letters
	    appear to be duplicated. This can be seen as a feature
	    rather than a useless redundancy. Often in, words will
	    have the same letter at both the beginning and end of a
	    syllable (e.g. <span class="ko-text">밥 pap</span> "rice",
	    <span class="ko-text">각 kak</span> "every"). Having some
	    letters appear more than once on the keyboard allows
	    typists to continue the same right-to-left rolling flow
	    even when consonants are repeated.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Another interesting feature of the 3-set setup is that
	    accidently pressing two keys together or in the wrong
	    sequence does not necessarily lead to a typo. As each
	    keypress is assigned a "place" in a syllabic block,
	    pressing the sets out of order (e.g. accidentally pressing
	    the left hand before the right hand) is a "forgivable"
	    error.  It is like being able to type 'a', 'c', 't' and
	    still getting the result <i>cat</i>. Wow!
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Three-set layouts are highly optimized for Korean. This is
	    not problematic because the <span class="ko-text">한글
	    hankul</span> script is pretty much only used to write
	    Korean. The same cannot be said of the Latin ("English")
	    alphabet, which is used with many languages.
	  </p>

	  <h4>3-beolshik 390</h4>
	  <p>
	    The <b>3-beolshik 390</b> layout featured in the image
	    above allows the user to enter integers in numpad like
	    manner with the right hand while SHIFT is held with the
	    left hand. The shift key on the right hand is used to
	    access less-commonly used final sounds.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    This layout requires some stretching sometimes as it makes
	    use of the number keys. Unlike with the 2-beolsik layout,
	    doubled consonants are <em>not</em> produced by holding
	    the shift button, but rather by pressing the correct
	    consonant's key twice, just as in typing English or any
	    other linearly arranged alphabetic language.
	  </p>

	  <img class="img-fluid" src="./images/3set390_heatmap.png" alt="3 Set Layout Heat Map">
	  <div class="caption"><p>Image source: <a href="https://xn--pk3bl9feqb.kr/">세벌식.kr</a></p></div>

	  <p>
	    Wow! What a comfy heat map! Below is a video of some high
	    speed 3-beolshik action.
	  </p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt9HnJeFRak" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	  <h4><span class="ko-text">안마태 Anmatay</span> Layout</h4>
	  <p>
	    The same 3-set principle used in the 3-beolshik 390 above
	    is used in other layouts as well. In the
	    <span class="ko-text">안마태 Anmatay</span> Layout,
	    initial sounds go on the top left, middle sounds go on the
	    top right, and final sounds go on the bottom
	  </p>
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ko/5/56/Anmatae.jpg" alt="Anmatay Layout">
	  <div class="caption"><p>Image source: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/%EA%B3%B5%EB%B3%91%EC%9A%B0_%EC%9E%90%ED%8C%90%EC%9D%98_%EC%A7%9C%EC%9E%84%EC%83%88.png">Wikipedia (Korean)</a></p></div>

	  <p>
	    This layout has some additional cool features. Like
	    3-beolshik 390, rather than use the shift key to enter
	    double consonants, Anmatay produces double consonants by
	    pressing the same key twice. Anmatay does away with even
	    more keys by allowing other consonants and consonant
	    combinations assigned their own key on 3-beolshik 390 to
	    be created by pressing sequences of keys. For instance:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><span class="ko-text">ㅈ + ㅎ = ㅊ</span>c + h = ch</li>
	    <li><span class="ko-text">ㄱ + ㅎ = ㅋ</span>c + h = ch</li>
	    <li><span class="ko-text">ㄱ + ㅇ = ㄲ</span>c + h = ch</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>
	    The last example given above involves typing a sequence of
	    characters not allowed in actual Korean as a compose
	    sequence for entering another sequence.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Anmatay also puts punctuation within closer reach via the
	    shift key as it doesn't need the number row like
	    3-beolshik 390 does.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Summary</h3>
	  <p>
	    2-beolshik is by far the most popular Korean keyboard
	    layout&mdash;the QWERTY of Korea. It is relatively
	    ergonomic compared to other default layouts of the world.
	    This layout is characterized by a two way separation of
	    consonants and vowels.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    3-beolshik layouts are less popular, but more ergonomic
	    for typing Korean. These layouts are arranged in a
	    three-section layout of Initial, Middle, and Final sounds
	    which correspond to the components making up a <b>syllabic
	    block</b> in Hangul. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Just as there is great diversity in keyboard layouts for
	    English and other layouts, there are many alternative
	    layouts for Korean. They tend to respect certain
	    principles:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Balance keystroke load on each hand</li>
	    <li>Avoid shift key when possible (i.e. don't key chord!)</li>
	    <li>
	      Utilize the basic 3-beolshik idea of separating the
	      keyboard in three sections, corresponding to Korean
	      orthography
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Mobile</h2>
	  <p>
	    Korean input methods for mobile devices can be divided
	    into two main flavors: (1) those that correspond with a PC
	    input method as described above, (2) mobile-first layouts.
	    Mobile first layouts typically have larger buttons
	    (corresponding to 10-key style phone key arrangements) and
	    may make use of actions such as swiping and holding down
	    keys to compose <span class="ko-text">hankul</span> syllabic blocks.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Keyboard-syle layouts will not be discussed here. They are
	    basically the same as in any other language.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Ten-Key Style Input Methods</h3>
	  <p>
	    Korean 10-key style input methods typically involve
	    selecting consonants by pressing a target 'base' consonant
	    and then sliding slightly up, down, left, right, or just
	    releasing the finger to get the correct character. A
	    similar method is used in Japanese kana-input systems with
	    ten-key-like interfaces. See
	    the <span class="ko-text">딩굴 Tingul</span> "Dingul"
	    input method in action below:
	  </p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tbxbutmi8FI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	  <p>
	    Vowels are a bit more interesting&mdash;they are composed
	    graphically in a manner similar to Chinese Canjie input
	    (albeit in a considerably simpler context).
