        <p>
          I took Spanish starting in middle school (not much), through
          high school (to AP level; I got a 5!), and then passively
          since. I've acquired and gone through a couple of books on
          Spanish grammar. I've read some books in Spanish. There are
          some people in my life I can talk Spanish with, but they all
          speak English very well so I don't practice too much, though
          maybe in 2020 that will change. Most of the Spanish I know
          is of Mexican/Latin American flavor as I live in California.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't typically feel too comfortable using Spanish with
          people that speak English well because English already
          serves the role as a "<b>lingua franca</b>" and I don't feel
          any particular affinity to Hispanic cultures I've
          encountered.
        </p>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>
          Tech support for Spanish is overall pretty good because
          Spanish is a widely used language that uses the Latin
          alphabet. Some things are suboptimal, like keyboard
          layouts&mdash;they are pretty much all based on QWERTY, with
          lots of hard to reach buttons in silly places (also, rarely
          used letters like <code>k</code> are in easy to reach
          places).
          <span lang="es">
            Uso <code>emacs</code> para teclar en espa√±ol.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus tech in Spanish is largely derivative of Anglo-designed
          tech, and usually a little bit worse. Expect ugly
          tildes/accent marks (i.e. <b>diacritics</b>), weirdo quote
          marks all over the place,
        </p>
