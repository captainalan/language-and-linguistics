            Spanish is the default foreign language to study in
            California (where I grew up). In the past year or so
            (writing this in Feb. 2020), I've begun to speak and read
            some more Spanish, but my learning as been largely passive
            for the past decade or so, picking up random words and
            grammar bits as I go.

        <h2>My Experience With Spanish</h2>
        <p>
          I took Spanish starting in middle school (not much), through
          high school (to AP level; I got a 5!), and then passively
          since. I've acquired and gone through a couple of books on
          Spanish grammar. I've read some books in Spanish. There are
          some people in my life I can talk Spanish with, but they all
          speak English very well so I don't practice too much, though
          maybe in 2020 that will change. Most of the Spanish I know
          is of Mexican/Latin American flavor as I live in California.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't typically feel too comfortable using Spanish with
          people that speak English well because English already
          serves the role as a "<b>lingua franca</b>" and I don't feel
          any particular affinity to Hispanic cultures I've
          encountered.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Learning Spanish</h2>
        <p>
          What follows applies from my experience as a native English
          speaker. I think this is not English-speaker specific stuff
          though.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="mb-4">Easy Stuff</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Plentiful resources&mdash;including rich lexical resources
            like
            the <a href="https://dle.rae.es/idioma?m=form"><span lang="es">Diccionario
            de la lengua espa単ola</span></a> from
            the <a href="https://www.rae.es/"><span lang="es">Real
            Academia Espa単ola</span></a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Spelling is pretty nice&mdash;you will naturally become
            acquainted with a handful of "rules"
          </li>
          <li>
            Widely spoken language with many native speakers
          </li>
          <li>
            Translations of almost everything <em>into</em> Spanish;
            if you want to practice Spanish without diving into native
            Spanish language literature you can most likely go read
            what you wanted to read in English in Spanish as well
          </li>
          <li>
            Interesting/diverse media&mdash;heck you could even
            watched Spanish dubbed anime lol
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          If you've studied a language that uses a non-alphabetic
          script, like <a href="../chinese/index.html">Chinese</a> you
          will very quickly come to appreciate the reasonableness of
          Spanish spelling and consequently how easy it is to look up
          unfamiliar words.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="mb-4">Hard Stuff</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Regional differences&mdash;Spanish is
            a <b>pluricentric</b> language meaning that there are many
            "standard" varieties of Spanish
          </li>
          <li>
            Vocabulary unlike anything you've seen&mdash;Spanish draws
            on many different languages. The more time you spend with
            it, the more strange words you will run into, regardless
            of what language(s) you come from.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hard to get perfect&mdash;if you do something like mix
            up <b>grammatical gender</b>, chances are you will be
            understood, but you will clearly sound <em>off</em>. Same
            thing with fancy verb endings. You can get by
            communicating most of the meanings you need to with a rich
            vocabulary and one week's worth of grammar, but it will
            take some serious time and practice to sound like a boss.
          </li>
          <li>
            I can only properly roll my <i>r</i>'s like 60% of the
            time still.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Should I learn Spanish?</h2>
        <p>
          If you live in a place with many Spanish speakers and you
          want to learn a second language, I would recommend learning
          Spanish. Knowing a little bit of Spanish can go a long way,
          and diving more into Spanish is a long road if you would to
          travel that way&mdash;there is always more to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if you don't live around many Spanish speakers, I would
          suggest learning Spanish <em>first</em> over some hipster
          language like Esperanto or some cultural appropriation
          language like Japanese (you weeb) because it is a
          relatively <b>"unmarked"</b> choice for a second language.
          Deciding to learn Spanish is a very normal, run-of-the-mill,
          perceived-as-useful thing to do. Like English, it useful in
          many places in the world, and its use is projected to grow
          in coming decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spanish has a very easy learning curve. It is easy to get
          started with Spanish right away, unlike with the East Asian
          languages which have all these funny symbols, very
          unfamiliar sounds to English speakers, etc. Spanish gets
          harder as you learn more, which can be a very good thing
          because this means you won't get bored.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Quick Facts</h2>
        <p>
          Spanish is a <b>pluricentric</b> language, meaning it has
          many "centers" from which users base standard
          speaking/writing. Pretty much all popular things translated
          into English are also translated into Spanish, so Spanish is
          a useful "global" (c.f. "<b>Western European</b>") language
          to learn. This usefulness has allowed Spanish to continue
          the <span lang="es">conquista</span> of the Americas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spanish has many, many speakers. Nonetheless, on the
          Internet, it is mostly used on US-owned mega-websites like
          Facebook and Google. Divided, the Spanish-speaking forces
          are not a very big Internet "<b>soft power</b>".
        </p>
        <p>
          English and Spanish are not readily <b>mutually
          intelligible</b>, meaning you can't just understand Spanish
          (to any sophisticated degree) without specialized training.
          Learning Spanish is therefore a useful thing to do if you
          plan on spending a lot of time with Spanish monolinguals.

        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>
          Tech support for Spanish is overall pretty good because
          Spanish is a widely used language that uses the Latin
          alphabet. Some things are suboptimal, like keyboard
          layouts&mdash;they are pretty much all based on QWERTY, with
          lots of hard to reach buttons in silly places (also, rarely
          used letters like <code>k</code> are in easy to reach
          places).
          <span lang="es">
            Uso <code>emacs</code> para teclar en espa単ol.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus tech in Spanish is largely derivative of Anglo-designed
          tech, and usually a little bit worse. Expect ugly
          tildes/accent marks (i.e. <b>diacritics</b>), weirdo quote
          marks all over the place,
