              Presented here are notes I'm collecting as I learn Greek.

            <h2>Which Greek?</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this method is to assist you in learning
                that Greek which will ultimately useful for the
                reading and interpretation of
                the <span class="term">Septuigant</span>. This means
                not only that text but also writings by Greek language
                authors past and present. So, there will be no
                direction mention of learning things that are only
                useful for reading ancient Greek (pagan) writings but
                helpful notes for learning (modern) Greek as it is
                used today.
            </p>
            <p>
              The emphasis here is on the <em>understanding</em> of
              written and spoken/sung Greek. How nice would it be to
              hear and understand beautiful Church music, study
              meticulously prepared books, and pray in the language of
              the source text of the Holy Scriptures!
            </p>

            <h2>The Method</h2>
            <p>
                First, learn <em>words</em>. In reading books, you
                will come across Greek terms. You can learn some basic
                morphology, but <em>do not first focus on
                "grammar"</em>. Instead, focus on learning
                proper <em>meanings</em> and their associated terms in
                whatever other languages you may need (e.g. English,
                Russian) as well as in Greek. As far as details
                go, <em>know how to spell words</em> to the level of
                detail you find appropriate&mdash;e.g. knowing a
                sequence of <em>letters</em> may be adequate for the
                level of proficiency you're concerned with as you are
                probably not an aspiring scholar of Ancient Greek if
                you're reading this page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Proper pronunciation can be learned by observing
              correspondences between writing and speech. Fortunately,
              there are many freely available resources to do this.
              Searching Youtube for things read (or sung, spoken) in
              Modern Greek will yield many results.
            <p>
            <p>
              Grammar can gradually be acquired, first though going
              through reference books to know what is "out there"
              (e.g. what are the different forms I will need to
              identify? Learning which declensions, verb conjugations,
              and so on I need to know about). As for the actual
              forms, I'll first understand meanings of sentences and
              then learn how to grammatically unpack words and
              sentences.
            </p>

            <h3>Computing</h3>
            <p>
              Learning to type Greek isn't so bad. One cool aspect of
              the Greek keyboard layout is that typing the requisite
              accent marks is very easy. Whereas in Western European
              langauges you might have to do some finger gymnastics to
              type the correct accent marks, in Greek you use the
              semicolon key which sits nicely on the homerow.
            </p>
            <p>
              I only care to type <span class="term">monotonic</span>
              Greek, associated with the modern language/spellings.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are some really cool looking Greek fonts;
              see <a href="">Google fonts</a>
            </p>

              about what is good/useful)
