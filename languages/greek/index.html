            <h1>Greek</h1>
            <p>Last updated October 13, 2021.</p>
            <p>
              Presented here are notes I'm collecting as I learn Greek. Compared
              with other European languages (like Spanish, French, and German) the
              resources for learning (Modern) Greek are relatively sparse.
              Navigating the many works for learning other varieties of Greek
              can be daunting&mdash;many things are called "Greek" and one cannot
              swallow all this knowledge at once!
            </p>
            <h2>Which Greek?</h2>
            <p>
              I would like to be able to read the <span class="term">Septuagint</span>
              as well as <span class="term">Modern Greek</span> so I can
              actually talk with people and understand audio/video. 
              How nice would it be to hear and understand beautiful
              Church music, study meticulously prepared books, and pray
              in the language of the source text of the Holy Scriptures!
              Modern Greek is a living language spoken in many countries,
              including the United States.
            </p>

            <h2>The Method</h2>
            <p>
              First, learn <em>words</em>. In reading books about
              topics like theology or classical civilizations, you
              will come across Greek terms. You can learn some basic
              morphology, but <em>do not first focus on
              "grammar"</em>. Instead, focus on learning
              proper <em>meanings</em> and their associated terms in
              whatever other languages you may need (e.g. English,
              Russian) as well as in Greek. As far as details
              go, <em>know how to spell words</em> to the level of
              detail you find appropriate&mdash;e.g. knowing a
              sequence of <em>letters</em> may be adequate for the
              level of proficiency you're concerned with as you are
              probably not an aspiring scholar of Ancient Greek if
              you're reading this page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Proper pronunciation can be learned by observing
              correspondences between writing and speech. Fortunately,
              there are many freely available resources to do this.
              Searching Youtube for things read (or sung, spoken) in
              Modern Greek will yield many results.
            <p>
            <p>
              Grammar can gradually be acquired, first though going
              through reference books to know what is "out there"
              (e.g. what are the different forms I will need to
              identify? Learning which declensions, verb conjugations,
              and so on I need to know about). As for the actual
              forms, I'll first understand meanings of sentences and
              then learn how to grammatically unpack words and
              sentences.
            </p>

            <h2>Computing/Technology</h2>
            <p>
              Learning to type Greek isn't so bad. One cool aspect of
              the Greek keyboard layout is that typing the requisite
              accent marks is very easy. Whereas in Western European
              languages you might have to do some finger gymnastics to
              type the correct accent marks, in Greek you use the
              semicolon key which sits nicely on the home row.
            </p>
            <p>
              I only care to type <span class="term">monotonic</span>
              Greek, associated with the modern language/spellings.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are some really cool looking Greek fonts;
              see <a href="">Google fonts</a>. After Latin characters,
              Greek characters along with Cyrillic characters are the
              next thing that are likely to be supported by some 
              font. For obvious reasons, it is easier to support these
              small-ish alphabets versus the complex scripts of East
              Asian, Indic, etc languages.
            </p>

            <h2>Reference Materials</h2>
            <p>
              These are reference materials I use.
            </p>
            <h3>Online</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.wiktionary.org">Wiktionary</a> particularly good for "rare" words, old words, and viewing declensions and conjugations</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.wordreference.com/gren/">WordReference</a> Modern Greek Dictionary</li> pretty sparse info; paper dictionaries have served me better
            </ul>
            <h3>Offline</h3>
            <p>
              Overall, I would recommend getting offline materials&mdash;you will save more time
              in the long run spending a few dozen dollars on some high quality resources which
              are easily replaced and shared. Plus, buying these items can send the message to
              publishers that people are interested in more (modern) Greek resources!
