            <h1>Greek</h1>
            <p>Last updated August 6, 2022.</p>
            <p>
              Presented here are notes I'm collecting as I learn Greek. Compared
              with other European languages (like Spanish, French, and German) the
              resources for learning (Modern) Greek are relatively sparse.
              Navigating the many works for learning other varieties of Greek
              can be daunting&mdash;many things are called "Greek" and one cannot
              swallow all this knowledge at once!
            </p>

            <h2>Which Greek?</h2>
            <p>
              I would like to be able to read the <span class="term">Septuagint</span>
              as well as <span class="term">Modern Greek</span> so I can
              actually talk with people and understand audio/video. 
              How nice would it be to hear and understand beautiful
              Church music, study meticulously prepared books, and pray
              in the language of the source text of the Holy Scriptures!
              Modern Greek is a living language spoken in many countries,
              including the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              Practically, dividing up languages into varieties (e.g. "Modern Greek",
              "Koine Greek", ...) is
              an academic exercise that is usually not-so-useful. The advantage of
              identifying a "target" to learn is to isolate things you don't know
              and build up a thorough competence in multiple domains where "Greek"
              may be used. Likewise, as you become more advanced, you will notice
              differences in <em>how</em> different speakers/sources use "Greek" (and
              thus identify what sounds "more modern", or "more archaic" and so on).
            </p>
            <p>
              Artificially <em>restricting</em> oneself to only one
              variety&mdash;such as textbook style Modern Greek&mdash;is not something
              native speakers do (and they probably couldn't, even if they wanted to!).
              Thus our approach here is to study "Greek" as "all that stuff written
              with αβγ..." and learn to understand everything starting with the easier
              modern standard stuff, staying alive with Scriptural quotations and
              hymns, and adding ancient stuff to <i>deboonk</i> modernity.

            <h2>Reference Materials</h2>
            <p>
              These are reference materials I use.
            </p>
            <h3>Online</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="./pages/grammar-summary.html">My Grammar</a> (Work In Progress</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.wiktionary.org">Wiktionary</a> particularly good for "rare" words, old words, and viewing declensions and conjugations</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.wordreference.com/gren/">WordReference</a> Modern Greek Dictionary</li> pretty sparse info; paper dictionaries have served me better
            </ul>
            <h3>Offline</h3>
            <p>
              Overall, I would recommend getting offline materials&mdash;you will save more time
              in the long run spending a few dozen dollars on some high quality resources which
              are easily replaced and shared. Plus, buying these items can send the message to
              publishers that people are interested in more (modern) Greek resources!
