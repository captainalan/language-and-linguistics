          Rather than doing a blog, I'm going to smash my findings
          altogether here. This section is ordered
          chronologically, oldest to newest, so it can be read
          from top to bottom. I reserve the right to re-write
          history, like other top-down planners. Ha!

        <h2>Trying new learning strategies</h2>
        <p>
          I approach German knowing many tips and tricks from
          studying other languages. These are explored in more
          detail on <a href="../../learning.html">my page on
            language learning</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Tooling</h3>
        <p>
          I would like to be able to study both online and
          offline.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Dictionaries</b>: digital one on my personal surveillance device, a couple paper ones</li>
          <li><b>Grammar book(s)</b>: shorter, study-guide-ish is better</li>
          <li><b>Phrase book</b>: cookbook for (practical) communication</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Grammar books are useful for getting a basic grasp of
          what there is in the grammar. I'm approaching this kind
          of like seeing what syntactic things are available in a
          programming language. A phrase book offers pre-cooked
          recipes to get through most basic communication needs.
          These are also good for building up a basic vocabulary.
        </p>

            Davis, CA &mdash; I'm glad I got ahold of <b>paper</b>
            resources because many online resources are lacking in
            things like stress/accent placement. Additionally, for
            learning resources, it is nice to have printed tables
            and such.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having studied other languages before German is nice
            because I can use nice resources
            like <a href="https://dict.naver.com/dekodict">Naver's
              German-Korean dictionary</a> (which also aggregates some
            English languages resources too).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm noticing some similarities to studying East Asian
            languages. In languages like Chinese, there are a lot of
            words made of combined parts (reflected as characters).
            German is kind of like this, except you don't have to
            remember thousands of characters. You just see letter
            sequences you recognize smashed together. I found that
            this is more so in German than in languages like
            Spanish, where lots of words seem to <b>atomic</b> (in
            the sense that they can't be broken down further in any
            way I see; linguistic fancy word is <b>monomorphemic</b>
            words).
          </p>
          <p>
            The main content I am looking at is Wikipedia. I haven't
            done much audio at all, just enough to learn basic
            (intelligible) pronunciation and be able to dictate
            words I hear. I like to read Wikipedia.

          <h3>Update: August 29, 2020</h3>
          <p>
            After spending some time studying Russian, German feels quite
            easy/accessible. Compared with Russian,
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Syntactic and morphological forms are more similar to English.</li>
            <li>There are fewer cases</li>
            <li>There is more vocabulary overlap</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Overall, I still find the German writing system to be pretty
            intuitive and easy to use.
