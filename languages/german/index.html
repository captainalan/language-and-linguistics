	  <h1>German</h1>
	  <p>
	    I am new to studying German, so this page is mostly
	    dedicated to documenting my journey from being a complete
	    beginner to hopefully a proficient speaker/writer.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Interest/Motivation</h2>
	  <p>
	    I want to learn some German to (1) experience what
	    learning English might be like for billions of people
	    around the globe, and (2) access mostly 19th-20th century
	    German art, literature, music, science, philosophy, etc.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I get the impression that learning German is difficult in
	    many of the same ways English is. For instance, there are
	    lots of prepositions, confusing patterns with
	    articles/determiners, contraction firms (e.g. <i>beim</i>
	    from <i>bei</i> + <i>dem</i>), accents to memorize on
	    words, a relatively complex phonology, and
	    slang/vernacular usages that differ from standard users.
	    On the other hand, I expect German to be easy like English
	    in that resources are plentiful, native speakers should
	    not be difficult to find, there is an alphabetic script,
	    and of course, there is lots of interesting stuff to
	    consume in this language.
	  </p>
	  

	  <h2>Trying new learning strategies</h2>
	  <p>
	    I approach German knowing many tips and tricks from
	    studying other languages. These are explored in more
	    detail on <a href="../../learning.html">my page on language
	    learning</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Tooling</h3>
	  <p>
	    I would like to be able to study both online and offline.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><b>Dictionaries</b>: digital one on my personal surveillance device, a couple paper ones</li>
	    <li><b>Grammar book(s)</b>: shorter, study-guide-ish is better</li>
	    <li><b>Phrase book</b>: cookbook for (practical) communication</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Grammar books are useful for getting a basic grasp of what
	    there is in the grammar. I'm approaching this kind of like
	    seeing what syntactic things are available in a
	    programming language. A phrase book offers pre-cooked
	    recipes to get through most basic communication
	    needs. These are also good for building up a basic
	    vocabulary.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Goal is to be able to use dictionary effectively
	  </p>

	  <h2>Some things I'm finding</h2>
	  <p>
	    Rather than doing a blog, I'm going to smash my findings
	    altogether here. This section is ordered chronologically,
	    oldest to newest, so it can be read from top to bottom. I
	    reserve the right to re-write history, like other top-down
	    planners. Ha!
	  </p>
	  <h3>Update: February 22, 2020</h3>
	  <p>
	    Davis, CA &mdash; I'm glad I got ahold
	    of <b>paper</b> resources because many online resources
	    are lacking in things like stress/accent
	    placement. Additionally, for learning resources, it is
	    nice to have printed tables and such.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Having studied other languages before German is nice
	    because I can use nice resources
	    like <a href="https://dict.naver.com/dekodict">Naver's
	    German-Korean dictionary</a> (which also aggregates some
	    English languages resources too).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I'm noticing some similarities to studying East Asian
	    languages. In languages like Chinese, there are a lot of
	    words made of combined parts (reflected as
	    characters). German is kind of like this, except you don't
	    have to remember thousands of characters. You just see
	    letter sequences you recognize smashed together. I found
	    that this is more so in German than in languages like
	    Spanish, where lots of words seem to <b>atomic</b> (in the
	    sense that they can't be broken down further in any way I
	    see; linguistic fancy word is <b>monomorphemic</b> words).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The main content I am looking at is Wikipedia. I haven't
	    done much audio at all, just enough to learn basic
	    (intelligible) pronunciation and be able to dictate words
	    I hear. I like to read Wikipedia.
