        <p>
          I am new to studying German, so this page is mostly
          dedicated to documenting my journey from being a
          complete beginner to hopefully a proficient
          speaker/writer.

        <h2>Interest/Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          I want to learn some German to (1) experience what
          learning English might be like for billions of people
          around the globe, and (2) access mostly 19th-20th
          century German art, literature, music, science,
          philosophy, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I get the impression that learning
          German is difficult in many of the same ways English is.
          For instance, there are lots of prepositions, confusing
          patterns with articles/determiners, contraction firms
          (e.g. <i>beim</i> from <i>bei</i> + <i>dem</i>), accents
          to memorize on words, a relatively complex phonology,
          and slang/vernacular usages that differ from standard
          users.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, I expect German to be easy like
          English in that resources are plentiful, native speakers
          should not be difficult to find, there is an alphabetic
          script, and of course, there is lots of interesting
          stuff to consume in this language. German is a widely
          spoken "world language" useful for accessing the words
          of many people of the past few hundred years.
        </p>
        <p>
          German also seems to be a popular language to know/study
          for European friends (probably after English and French,
          maybe before Italian&mdash;don't know the stats).
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, learning German will make looking at other
          related languages easier&mdash;e.g. Yiddish, the Nordic
          languages, German of early North American settlers.
        </p>

          As I learn German, I will be documenting my journey and
          providing free study resources.

        <h2>Trying new learning strategies</h2>
        <p>
          I approach German knowing many tips and tricks from
          studying other languages. These are explored in more
          detail on <a href="../../learning.html">my page on
            language learning</a>.

        <h3>Tooling</h3>
        <p>
          I would like to be able to study both online and
          offline.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Dictionaries</b>: digital one on my personal surveillance device, a couple paper ones</li>
          <li><b>Grammar book(s)</b>: shorter, study-guide-ish is better</li>
          <li><b>Phrase book</b>: cookbook for (practical) communication</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Grammar books are useful for getting a basic grasp of
          what there is in the grammar. I'm approaching this kind
          of like seeing what syntactic things are available in a
          programming language. A phrase book offers pre-cooked
          recipes to get through most basic communication needs.
          These are also good for building up a basic vocabulary.
