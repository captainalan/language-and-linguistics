	  <h1>Exploring Indonesian</h1>
	  <p>January 20, 2020&mdash;Alan W</p>
	  <p>
	    What follows are my impressions of Indonesian from going
	    through a couple books, using a few dictionaries, and
	    trying to converse with some fluent speakers over the
	    course of a few years or so.
	  </p>

	  <h2>What is it?</h2>
	  <p> <!-- An 'Artificial/Constructed Language'-->
	    <b>Indonesian</b> (called <i>Bahasa Indonesia</i> the
	    "Indonesian Language") is the <b>official/national</b>
	    language of Indonesia. It is a flavor of Malay and is very
	    similar to Malaysian (<i>Bahasa Melayu</i>), perhaps in a
	    way analagous to how British/American English or varieties
	    of Spanish across the globe differ from one another.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    "Indonesian" was not always spoken in Indonesia. The
	    "Indonesian" being discussed here descends from a variety
	    of Malay by traders in the region. Nationalists in the
	    20th century created Indonesian through standardization
	    efforts, promoting this common language over other
	    languages such as the Javanese language, which was already
	    spoken natively by a large portion of present day
	    Indonesia's population.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Indonesian stands out among the world's language in being
	    a "native" national language (c.f. Spanish in Latin
	    America, French in North Africa) of a relatively large
	    nation state that went through long periods of occupation.
	  </p>

	  <h3>How many people speak it?</h3>
	  <p>
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language">Wikpedia</a>
	    cites 43 million native speakers and 156 million second
	    language (L2) speakers (2010 census). Of these L2 speakers, Wikipedia states
	 
	  </p>
	  <blockquote>
	    ...over 200 million people regularly make use of the
	    national language, with varying degrees of proficiency.
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>
	    Indonesia's population as of 2010 is estimated to be
	    237.64 million
	    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Indonesia">Wikipedia</a>).
	    This means that roughly 18% of Indonesia's population
	    claim to be native speakers and that 65% claim some degree
	    of proficiency.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    These figures are hard to make sense of without further
	    information about how proficiency of speakers was measured
	    among other things. However, there are at least a couple
	    things we can conclude pretty decisively:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Indonesian <em>is</em> a "healthy" language, we can
	      expect to stick around for a while... it is not
	      endangered.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Indonesian is <em>not</em> the dominant language of
	      Indonesia&mdash;local (non-national) languages define
	      everyday talking, and other languages like English and
	      Chinese bridge Indonesia to the broader outside world.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    As Indonesia's population continues to grow as well as its
	    rates of urbanization, I predict that the use of
	    Indonesian will likely grow as well, at least within urban
	    areas.
	  </p>

	  <h2>What's it like?</h2>
	  <p>
	    Indonesian <em>looks</em> very approachable. If you
	    na√Øvely tried to pronounce the following paragraph, you'd
	    probably do a half-decent job, particularly if you have
	    had experience learning another language or were taught
	    the basics of Indonesian pronunciation for even less than
	    an hour.
	  </p>
	  <blockquote>
	    Bahasa Indonesia adalah bahasa Melayu yang dijadikan sebagai bahasa
	    resmi Republik Indonesia dan bahasa persatuan bangsa Indonesia. Bahasa
	    Indonesia diresmikan penggunaannya setelah Proklamasi Kemerdekaan
	    Indonesia, tepatnya sehari sesudahnya, bersamaan dengan mulai
	    berlakunya konstitusi. Di Timor Leste, bahasa Indonesia berstatus
	    sebagai bahasa kerja.
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>
	    As with other languages with relatively newly created
	    writing systems, Indonesian spelling has a very close
	    correspondence with actual prounciation. Learning a couple
	    of simple rules (e.g. 'c' is pronounced like 'ch' in
	    English) you can quickly get up to speed pronouncing
	    understandable Indonesian.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    A quick look at the paragraph above reveals much. Notice
	    that Indonesian does not have complex consonant clusters
	    (think German words <i>schl...</i>, Russian
	    words <i>vl...</i>).  Punctuation, spacing, capitalization
	    and other conventions are very similar to those of
	    European languages (c.f. Chinese and Japanese don't use
	    spaces). You won't have to learn a new keyboard layout to
	    type Indonesian&mdash;lots of things here should look
	    very familiar.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    To hear a sample of spoken Indonesia, check
	    out <a href="https://www.voaindonesia.com/z/421">Voice of
	    America Indonesia </a> (long samples of relatively formal
	    spoken Indonesian).
	  </p>

	  <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
	  <p>
	    Indonesian vocabulary comes from many sources including
	    Malay, Javanese, Chinese, Dutch, and English. As with many
	    other languages, many more recent borrowings are from
	    English or are transparently related to English words by
	    shared (European) origin. In the quote below, I bolded
	    (English) cognate words:
	  </p>
	  <blockquote>
	    Setiap paginya, VOA menyiarkan sebuah <b>program</b> <b>informatif</b>
	    sejam penuh. Siaran Pagi menghidangkan beragam <b>topik</b> yang
	    menarik;berita <b>internasional</b> dan <b>nasional</b>, tajuk rencana,
	    <b>bisnis</b> dan keuangan [...]
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>
	    In discussing about science and technology, society, business
	    government, and other topics of "higher learning", you can
	    expect many, many English cognates.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I imagine talking about religious matters (e.g. aspects of
	    Islam in Indonesia) there are many, many Arabic, Persian,
	    etc. loan words.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Grammar</h3>
	  <p>
	    Indonesian is in many ways a very simple language. Native
	    speakers may describe it as having "no grammar",
	    reflecting the fact that it does not have complex verb
	    conjugations, gender on nouns, or a case system (at least
	    in the same sort of explicitly marked, formally
	    established way that European languages do).
	    etc.
	  </p>

	  <h3>The learning experience</h3>
	  <p>
	    The biggest challenge I found studying Indonesian was
	    finding current, comprehensive resources. Not yet being
	    proficient enough to use monolingual Indonesian resources
	    (e.g. the <em>Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia</em> "Big
	    Indonesian
	    Dictionary" <a href="https://www.kbbi.web.id/">KBBI</a>),
	    I mostly had resources targeted at either academics
	    (grammars describing the language, but not made for
	    teaching) and tourists (quick and easy phrase books) at my
	    disposal. With my background studying East Asian
	    languages, I could make use of resources such as Naver and
	    Daum's online dictionaries (Korean). I imagine in Asia and
	    Australia there are more resources available for learning
	    Indonesian.
	  </p>
	  <p>

	  </p>
	  <p> <!-- Explain how learning Indonesia was hard -->
	    Indonesian grammar is something that it is difficult to
	    find rigorous descriptions of. Unlike languages such as
	    French and Japanese where resources abound, Indonesian
	    resources are not always easy to find and may not be
	    many decades old.
	  </p>

	  <p>

	  </p>

	  <h2>Should I study Indonesian?</h2>
	  <p>
	    It might make sense to study some Indonesian if one of the
	    two statements below is true of you.
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      There are important people in your life that use
	      Indonesian or you are living in or traveling to
	      Indonesia
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      You have an interest in the history of
	      Indonesia <em>or</em> in nation building projects of the
	      20th century
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    However, Indonesian has some tough competition, even
	    within Indonesia.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <b>Arabic</b> is studied widely and respected as the
	      language of the <i>Qur'an</i>. As Indonesia is a
	      Muslim-majority country, this means studying/knowing
	      Arabic is very prestigious.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <b>English</b> is useful for science, technology,
	      entertainment, etc. Australia is not so far away. No
	      need to explain further why people want to learn
	      English!
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <b>Chinese/Japanese/Korean</b> Chinese is especially
	      influential because of Chinese populations in Southeast
	      Asia. Japanese and Korean are widely looked at because
	      of anime, pop music, films, and the like.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Indonesian seems to be a fairly useful language in
	    Indonesia, but probably not the only one you will need
	    to get a good understanding of what is going on there.
