	      <b>Chinese Characters</b>, also called "Sinographs",
	      "Han Ideograms", and all sorts of other things (not to
	      mention <i>kanji</i> in Japanese, <i>hanja</i> in
	      Korean...) are boxy-shaped things, written for many
	      hundreds of years using brush and ink. In recent times,
	      they have been immortalized in standards
	      like <a href="http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_chinese.html">Unicode</a>,
	      ensuring they will remain with humanity for the
	      foreseeable Internet. Let's dive in!
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      For the most part in this article, I will discuss
	      Chinese characters in the context of Chinese
	      ("Mandarin"), but the analysis and discussion presented
	      here can readily be extended to Japanese <i>kanji</i> as
	      well, <i><a href="../japanese/index.html">desu</a></i>.
	    </p>

	    <h2>On the meanings of individual characters</h2>
	    
	    <p>
	      What does a Chinese character mean? Chinese characters
	      typically have some fuzzy meanings associated with them,
	      and many can function as stand-alone words, but usually
	      they are used as parts of compounds of multiple
	      characters (often 2-4). For example, one might say 人
	      has the meaning "person". The meanings of some words
	      follow in a more-or-less straight forward way:
	    </p>

	    <ul>
	      <li>美国人 měiguó-rén &mdash; "America + Person = American"</li>
	      <li>无人机 wúrén-jī &mdash; "Without Person + Machine = Drone"</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>
	      However, nice patterns like this quickly break down when
	      discussing characters associated with more abstract
	      meanings. Characters can have may mean quite different
	      things in different words. The meanings of many words
	      are not compositional in that you cannot deduce the
	      meaning of a word from its parts. You must memorize the
	      meaning of a whole word.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      For example, consider the character 上 shàng, which is
	      very common. You can see this in many words/phrases
	      like:
	    </p>

	    <ul>
	      <li>上学 shàngxué &mdash; "attend school"</li>
	      <li>晚上　wǎnshàng &mdash; "in the evening"</li>
	      <li>上海 shànghǎi &mdash; “Shanghai (place)"</li>
	      <li>上 shǎng &mdash; "(name of 3rd Chinese tone); falling and then rising"</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>
	      So while in many cases, Chinese characters are
	      associated with some relatively easy to pin down
	      meaning, in other cases, asking what a Chinese character
	      means is like asking what "the letter c" means; there
	      isn't a really good answer besides that it is a glyph
	      (symbol) used to write a language.
	    </p>
	    
	    <h2>On reading Chinese characters</h2>
	    <p>
	      For historical reasons, Chinese characters are often
	      associated with <em>multiple</em> pronunciations
	      each. Learning to read Chinese means learning to read
	      characters in the context of words they appear.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      To extend the example given earlier, this is like saying
	      "how do you pronounce the letter <i>c</i> in English?"
	      The annoying, but true answer is that <em>"it depends..."</em>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Some rabid Chinese chararcter loving traditionalists
	      might tell you something like "learning Chinese to read
	      Chinese characters is easy, you just look at
	      such-and-such <i>radical</i> and you can guess correctly most of
	      the time" (a <b>radical</b> is a discrete, identifiable part of
	      a Chinese character). It is true that the form of
	      chracters may give <em>hints</em> about how a
	      character <em>may</em> be pronounced. However, one
	      cannot systematically derive pronunciations from
	      graphical forms in Chinese in this way.
	    </p>

	    <h2>Can we get ever get rid of Chinese characters?</h2>
	    <p>
	      Languages like <a href="../korean/index.html">Korean</a>
	      and Vietnamese have largely done away with Chinese
	      characters. However, these languages have relatively
	      more complex sound systems (<b>phonologies</b> in linguo
	      jargon) than Chinese ("Mandarin"). Likewise, they (here
	      I mainly know Korean) make less referenes to literary
	      Chinese this-and-that in contemporary times, which makes
	      ditching Chinese characters much more feasible.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      My impression is that Chinese cannot be written without
	      Chinese characters <em>without drastically changing the
	      language itself</em>. By this I mean, (1) avoiding
	      literary/classical idioms, (2) selecting against
	      ambiguous vocabulary, (3) choosing non-character sources
	      to create new vocabulary (e.g. English, Russian),
	      (4) <em>not</em> referring to Chinese characters in
	      speech and writing...
	    </p>

	    <h2>Technology and Chinese Characters</h2>
	    <p>
	      Nowadays, typing Chinese is not so difficult. See 
	      "<a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/chinese_input_methods.html">Chinese
	      Input Methods</a>" (Xah Lee 2017) for an overview (with pics).
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      One thing that continues to bother me about Chinese
	      characters is that <em>although modern input systems are
	      fast and convenient, they are often cloud
	      based</em>. That means that when typing languages like
	      Chinese and Japanese you are often uploading tons of
	      data (N-grams) to Google and the like to harvest and
	      analyze. In alphabetic languages, like English, you are
	      at least getting a more or less direct key press to
	      output experience. Typing Chinese Characters is like
	      routing everything through another layer of abstraction,
	      as is done on smart phones.
	    </p>
	    
	    <h3>Looking up Chinese Characters like a dinosaur</h3>
	    <p>
	      Chinese dictionaries are nowadays most often organized
	      by pronunciation. Characters are arranged according to
	      their most common pronunciation, in the order of
	      the <i>Pīnyīn</i> (standard Romanization) alphabet.
	      Once you are already familiar with at least one
	      pronunciation of a character, this is probably the
	      fastest lookup method.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      However, when looking up characters for the first time,
	      a more involved procedur is needed. In most look-up
	      systems you will have to:
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Identify a main <b>radical</b></li>
	      <li>Count remaining strokes in the character, minus that radical</li>
              <li>
		Look up the radical you first identified, in an index
		organized by (brush) <b>stroke count</b>.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Find the character you are looking for under a section
		headed by the radical. Characters under each radical
		heading will in turn be organized by stroke count.
		Note the standard pronunciation of the chracter given.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Use the <i>pīnyīn</i> alphabetical index to look up
		the character <em>by pronunciation</em> (LOLOLOLOL).
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	    <p>
	      Unlike dinosaurs, Chinese characters haven't died out.
