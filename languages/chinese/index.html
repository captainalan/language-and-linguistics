        <p>
          Here are some conventions I currently am making use of.
          By having standard operating procedures (yeah.. yeah... the business people understand some of these things well)
          we can ensure a consistent, quality experience for all üï¥
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Make use of existing standardization efforts.</b> For foreigners, we can make use of <b>HSK</b> vocab, grammar, etc.
          to establish a "common core" of things we can expect one another to know.</li>
          <li>
            <b>"Code switch" over proliferating confusion.</b> The convention that I am adopting in Chinese is to just use normal
            Romanized spellings for names of Western things, for example. So I can write ‰Ω†ÂêÉËøátacosÊ≤°ÊúâÔºü [ni3 chi1guo TACOS mei2you3?] "have you tried TACOS"
            instead of trying to make up some weird phonetic transcription of "tacos". A corollary to this is that, if one would like to
            speak more "pure Chinese", they can simply avoid loan words that demand switching to another writing system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Use Pinyin to help your readers.</b> In Japanese, it is common to have <i>furigana</i> annotations in materials for learners (e.g. grade school students)
            as well as for adult readers when presenting something that is just... uncommon/difficult.
            We can use this technique to help improve Chinese literacy.
            While the "number system" isn't especially pleasant to look at (then again, lots of digital text is quite ugly...), I prefer it overall
            because it is significantly easier to type than the correct accent marks. If you would like to learn/use Chinese well with
            lots of different people, it is necessary for the methods you employ to be easily usable/accessible to non-nerds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Share/Cite Reference Texts</b>. I am not mainly talking about "grammar books", but rather sources of "correct Chinese";
            In order for a standard to succeed, people must have examples of proper standard usage.

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
          Below are some online English language resources I use.
        </p>
        <h3>Online</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary">MDBG Dictionary</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zhongwen-chinese-english/kkmlkkjojmombglmlpbpapmhcaljjkde">Zhongwen: Chinese-English Dictionary</a> (popup browser dictionary)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          What sort of Chinese language content do you look at?
          My current "go-to" translation of the Bible is the Êñ∞ËØëÊú¨ [Xin1yi4ben3] "New Translation", which can be found <a href="http://www.godcom.net/xinyiben/">here</a>.
          For political babble, I go to <a href="https://www.voachinese.com/">VOA Chinese</a> because it loads fast enough in the USA and there is lots of audio/video.
        </p>
        <h3>Paper</h3>
        <p>
          'cause looking at screens sux
        </p>
        <p>
          In Asia, lots of study materials are available, but not all of those are readily available in the USA.
          I'm looking for useful materials that readily available/purchasable from Establishment enterprises like Amazon.
