            Below, I summarize my experience learning
            Chinese as well as offer some opinions and guidance for
            those who also may be interested in doing so.

          <h2>Is Chinese for me?</h2>
          <p>
            In summary, I think Chinese is a good language to learn
            if you are interested in China and/or talking with
            Chinese people. However, I think learners should be
            warned of the mysticism and hippie dippy new age
            thinking surrounding Chinese (as well as other Asian
            languages, and second language learning in general) and
            consider carefully whether or not Chinese specifically
            is worth their time&mdash;the irrepairable bloat of the
            Chinese writing system and its influences on spoken
            Chinese present serious barriers for time-pressed
            learners to make fast progress. Furthermore, confusion
            about Modern Standard Chinese (<i>pǔtōnghuà</i>) leads to
            even more suffering.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <p>
            Chinese is very different from English and people in
            China/Taiwan/etc. often have very different ways of
            thinking and talking about things compared with
            Westerners. If you take your Chinese learning far, it
            will certainly broaden your view of the world. Most
            Chinese speakers do not speak English, so learning
            Chinese is practical for communication purposes,
            especially if you are going to live in China for a while
            or something like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you seriously study Chinese, chances are the people
            around you will regard you as very studious and smart.
            You can virtue signal your cosmopolitan alignment and
            eagerness to profit from globalization through Chinese
            study. Students of Chinese are generally less despised
            than <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Weeb">weebs</a>.
            You will definitely run into annoying problems with
            fonts, displaying text, particularly if you also use Japanese.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <p>
            Chinese has a terrible writing system that makes your
            life difficult. The complexity of the Chinese writing
            systems means you either have to use dinosaur techniques
            to look things up (i.e. paper tables, dictionaries,
            counting strokes, and other archaic arts) <i>or</i> you
            have to embrace the surveillance state a bit and squint
            at your phone while scribbling lines with a finger. In
            any case, the written language <em>will definitely</em>
            require a lot of time on your part. If you do become
            proficient in Chinese, you can assume every character
            you type is being logged in somebody's database
            somewhere; the complexity of Chinese writing
            necessitates cloud-based typing for most people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite having many speakers, Chinese is not an
            "international" language in the sense that it is
            "ethnically bound" to Han Chinese people. If you don't
            look Chinese, you will forever be treated like a monkey
            in a suit while speaking Chinese. Nobody knows if you
            are a dog on the Internet, so you may be able to sneak
            by there though.

          <h2>My experience with Chinese</h2>
          <p>
            I began learning Chinese toward the end of my high
            school days, intensely through my undergraduate days,
            and casually to the present day. I started Chinese from
            scratch&mdash;my parents never spoke to me in any form
            of Chinese and I had studied Spanish prior to my
            university years.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
          <p>
            Chinese is rather easy to begin with
            but later becomes very difficult, perhaps exponentially
            difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting Chinese is easy for the following reasons:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Novelty factor, fun</li>
            <li>Relatively few sounds</li>
            <li>Many high quality beginner resources available</li>
            <li>Endless encouragement, especially if you are not ethnically Chinese, and even more so if you are good looking</li>
          </ul> 
          
          <p>
            However, moving beyond a basic conversational level,
            things get more difficult. This is mainly due to the
            direct and indirect effects of the Chinese writing
            system:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Looking up Chinese characters/words is difficult</li>
            <li>Classical/literary Chinese stuff pops up</li>
            <li>You realize the Chinese movie you wanted to watch is in Cantonese, not the language you are studying</li>
            <li>People keep on "code-switching" into English or using English words instead of helping you build your Chinese vocabulary (often because they themselves use these terms mainly)</li>
            <li>Chinese subs are low quality</li>
            <li>Chinese Internet blocks your country</li>
            <li>You develop myopia</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            The best solution(s) I have found to overcome these
            difficulties are to use a <b>pop-up dictionary</b> via a
            browser extension, primarily reading Chinese text on the
            computer. This combined with increasing font size can
            save your eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, media besides hypertext remains hard to
            work with: novels, text on phones, movies/shows,
            etc. I'll continue to try to develop my vocabulary
            mainly from the browser and audio/video to dodge
            character lookup annoyances, but isn't preferable and
            I find it much more pleasurable to study other languages
            where I don't have to deal with these artifacts of an
            unfixable writing system.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Tech Notes</h3>
          <p>
            On web pages when using Chinese, always use
            the <code>lang</code> attribute to specify which text is
            Chinese. Otherwise, you might get Chinese characters
            rendered as if Japanese or some other issues. For
            readability, this probably won't matter, but it will look
            bad.
          </p>
          <p>
            I type <span class="pinyin">Hànyǔ pīnyīn</span> using
            emacs' <code>chinese-sisheng</code> input method. I have
            yet to find a better solution; <span lang="zh-SC">真方便！
