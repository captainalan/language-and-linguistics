** Planned updates
*** Language Pages
**** Chinese   
**** Japanese
     Provide some information on how to use Japanese resources
**** Korean
**** Latin Learning Pages
***** TODO Add navigation to go through lessons
      Maybe this can be done in the common.js file imported by all
      lessons.
***** DONE Refactor common functions into shared file
***** TODO Make pages for all noun declensions
      Later, I can edit the example sentences for more variety.
      Introduce some useful grammatical concepts
***** TODO Adjectives
      Introduce after nouns, easily introduce grammatical /agreement/.
      Adjective pages can use many of the same nouns as the noun pages.
***** TODO Pronouns
***** TODO Demonstratives
