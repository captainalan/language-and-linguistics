	  <h2>Good ideas</h2>
	  <p>
	    Below are some tips/hints on language learning I've
	    developed over the last decade or so.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Immersion Approaches</h3>
	  <p>
	    In general, I think <b>"Immersion" approaches</b> to
	    language learning are best. This doesn't mean you have to
	    pretend to be a four year old (you can never go back
	    there), but rather to <em>always expose yourself to
	    language in the context of meaning</em>. Don't just try to
	    "study" some words, <em>find uses for those words</em> and
	    <em>observe how skilled speakers use them</em>. This could
	    mean lots of things: cooking with your grandmother,
	    watching videos on the Internet, loitering in a supermarket...
	    Learn by observing (speech) behavior.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Respect the Authority of Native Speakers</h3>
	  <p>
	    I find it productive to <b>accept the authority of "native
	    speakers"</b> on the language(s) they speak. Your goal is
	    to successfully reproduce certain patterns, so don't argue
	    with people that can do what you can't. Instead, try to
	    see how they are right ("in their own way"), even if what
	    they are saying goes against your other learning. This may
	    be difficult for linguists who have learned to hate
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription">prescriptive
	    grammar</a>. 
	  </p>
	  <h3>Avoid Unnecessary Explanations</h3>
	  <p>
	    Take <em>all</em> explanations with a grain of salt. Focus
	    on learning to reproduce <b>patterns</b> first, and only
	    later be concerned with "explaining" those patterns, if
	    you find that fun. Don't be a nerd, explaining everything for
	    eons. Just do.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Stay Motivated</h3>
	  <p>
	    Above all, <b>keep motivation high</b>, which often means
	    <em>listening to boredom</em> (think: <em>why am I
	      bored?</em>) and avoiding complicated explanations,
	    which are usually boring. Classrooms are infamous for making fun
	    things boring; get out of the classroom if that is how you
	    find your funzies.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Been there, done that</h2>
	  <p>
	    For a long while, I used <b>Spaced Repetition Systems</b>
	    ("digital flashcards"). Eventually I stopped. While I
	    think it is possible to use these systems effectively,
	    paired with other materials, a language partner, etc. I
	    think that they are not sufficient as a <em>main</em>
	    study method because they present you with lots of "data"
	    without context. While it is possible to add images,
	    sentences, etc. to digital flashcards, at a certian point
	    doing this becomes more of a pain in the ass than a help.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Language Learners in Society</h2>
	  <p>
	    If you are not a child or a very attractive person
	    (e.g. one who possesses great beauty, wealth, etc.), you
	    may find language learning difficult. It is time to be
	    humble. Most people won't have an automatically given
	    reason to talk to you, so it is your job to make yourself
	    worth time and attention. Can you be a much better than
	    average listener? Will you do some manual labor (e.g. hang
	    out and rake some leaves, wash dishes)? What are you
	    willing to do to earn the opportunity to siphon some
	    language knowledge?

	  <h2>Links & Resources</h2>

	  <p>Gathered here are links to freely available tools and
	  resources which I have found useful.</p>

	  <h3>References</h3>
	  <p>
	    For <b>language learning</b> the most important thing I
	    look for in a dictionary is <em>lots of example
	    sentences</em>. Often better than any explanation of how
	    some grammar thing works is the form in question <em>in
	    actual use</em>. Many freely accessible (as in beer, not
	    freedom) websites provide useful dictionaries in many
	    languages. For instance, I often
	    use <a href="https://endic.naver.com/?sLn=en">Naver's
	    dictionaries</a>, which are available for English, Korean,
	    Chinese, Japanese...
