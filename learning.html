              Collected here are general recommendations for getting
              the most out of your time studying languages as well as
              explanations as to why the listed "good ideas" work.
              I've spent a lot of time studying a lot of different
              languages, so I share my experiences here in hope that
              you can <em>not waste</em> time repeating mistakes that
              I've had to work through.

          <h2>Good ideas</h2>
          <p>
            Below are some tips/hints on language learning I've
            developed over the last decade or so. They should be
            adequately general to apply to studying any (living)
            language.
          </p>

          <h3>Immersion Approaches</h3>
          <p>
            In general, I think <b>"Immersion" approaches</b> to
            language learning are best. This doesn't mean you have to
            pretend to be a four year old (you can never go back
            there), but rather to <em>always expose yourself to
            language in the context of meaning</em>. Don't just try to
            "study" some words, <em>find uses for those words</em> and
            <em>observe how skilled speakers use them</em>. This could
            mean lots of things: cooking with your grandmother,
            watching videos on the Internet, loitering in a
            supermarket... Learn by observing (speech) behavior.
          </p>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">The interior of a British submarine&mdash;spending time with foreigners in a submarine is one sort of "immersion" approach.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h3>Learn the Grammar</h3>
          <p>
            Do learn the <b>formal</b> grammar of languages you are
            studying&mdash;by this I mean <em>what are the different
            (word) forms used in a language and where are they
            used?</em> For an Indo-European language, this probably
            means being able to reproduce charts of verb conjugations,
            noun declensions, and so forth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason you have to do this is so that you
            can <em>learn to do things the right way</em>. The
            aforementioned "immersion approach" is necessary to see
            the correct use of a language. However, if the grammar of
            a language you are studying is already systematically laid
            out somewhere, why not speed up the learning process
            through some discipline and memorization?
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Do</em> memorize the forms and also know the
            terminology to talk about grammar (e.g. "use the genitive
            form after such and such preposition"), but <em>do
            not</em> concern yourself with translating everything in
            your head. This is one thing the study of modern languages
            (over the past couple hundred years at least) has taught
            us&mdash;to learn a language is to learn
            to <em>speak</em>. You learn grammar by repeatedly being
            exposed to and using correct forms.
          </p>

          <h3>Respect the Authority of Native Speakers</h3>
          <p>
            I find it productive to <b>accept the authority of "native
            speakers"</b> on the language(s) they speak. Your goal is
            to successfully reproduce certain patterns, so don't argue
            with people that can do what you can't. Instead, try to
            see how they are right ("in their own way"), even if what
            they are saying goes against your other learning. This may
            be difficult for linguists who have learned to hate
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription">prescriptive
            grammar</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            When approaching new things, we often carry with us
            "theoretical baggage". Someone might approach Spanish, for
            instance, assuming that there aren't really two genders
            but all of this is a social construct. And so, they might
            only be willing to think of Spanish in terms of "having
            two arbitrary noun categories". <i>Abuela</i> probably has
            no idea what you're talking about and likely isn't
            interested in using your Critical Theory™ to desconstruct
            her worldview.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is better to listen and learn first; the time to speak
            freely may come, but especially while learning it is best
            to not get too caught up in whatever neurolinguistically
            motivated theory you might have read about last.
          </p>

          <h3>Avoid Unnecessary Explanations</h3>
          <p>
            Take <em>all</em> explanations with a grain of salt. Focus
            on learning to reproduce <b>patterns</b> first, and only
            later be concerned with "explaining" those patterns, if
            you find that fun. Don't be a nerd, explaining everything
            for eons. Just do.
          </p>

          <h3>Stay Motivated</h3>
          <p>
            Above all, <b>keep motivation high</b>, which often means
            <em>listening to boredom</em> (think: <em>why am I
	      bored?</em>) and avoiding complicated explanations,
            which are usually boring. Classrooms are infamous for making fun
            things boring; get out of the classroom if that is how you
            find motivation.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are just starting to learn some other language, a
            good question to ask may be <em>why am I learning this
            particular language?</em> A good answer to this question
            from the outset (e.g. "I'm learning Vietnamese to speak
            with my cousins in Vietnam") is all you need to stay
            motivated. Asking this question may be a good way to
            figure out you need to spend <em>less</em> time with some
            particular language and concentrate your efforts on
            something else&mdash;this is something I need to remind
            myself of often since I would easily spend a whole day
            studying many, many languages that have no practical use
            for me.

          <h2>Been there, done that</h2>
          <p>
            For a long while, I used <span class="term">Spaced
            Repetition Systems</span> ("digital flashcards").
            Eventually I stopped. While I think it is possible to use
            these systems effectively, paired with other materials, a
            language partner, etc. I think that they are not
            sufficient as a <em>main</em> study method because they
            present you with lots of "data" without context. While it
            is possible to add images, sentences, etc. to digital
            flashcards, at a certian point doing this becomes more of
            a pain in the ass than a helpful technique. One big
            resason for this is that you are relying on some software
            that could break, data that could get corrupted easily,
            etc. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Do keep your own notes on what does/doesn't work for you.
            You can be "scientific" by carefully observing what sorts
            of approaches do and don't work out for you with each
            language you study.
          </p>


          <h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>
          <p>
            Gathered here are links to freely available tools and
            resources which I have found useful.
          </p>
          <h3>Bootstrapping Learning by Mastering Essential Skills</h3>
          <p>
            There are some things you're going to have to do a lot of,
            no matter which languages you choose to study. Namely,
            you're going to have to find out more information about
            your target language. You should thus become proficient
            at <b>pronunciation</b>, <b>dictionary/reference
            lookup</b> and/or <b>digital input</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pronunciation mainly matters for those that care about
            spoken languages (i.e. normal, social people), but habing
            intelligible pronunciation can be very helpful for talking
            about "dead" languages at well. Knowing the
            "meta-vocabulary" to talk about a language can be helpful
            for getting new information about it from people who are
            already proficient in it. One trick I've learned to
            quickly get a decent grasp on prounciation is to search
            YouTube or some other site for a "Top 100 Words in XYZ"
            type video. You can then watch a native speaker go through
            some basic vocabulary, greetings, etc. and take note of
            how some very common words are pronounced and how they
            correspond to orthography. For learning a language where
            no patient native speakers are available, this is very
            helpful. Another thing I've found helpful is to listen to
            some broadcast like Voice of America that is <em>saying
            stuff you expect</em>. That's right&mdash;you listen to
            American/Western propaganda (or whatever you are familiar
            with) so you <em>already know the meanings</em> being
            presented, get a lot of cognates, and then are just left
            with the problem of how to re-assemble these parts. All
            the while, you are training your listening comprehension
            and pronunciation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dictionary lookup is a good skill to develop toward the
            relative beginning of your language learning journey for
            some given language. (As you advance you will need the
            "crutch" of a dictionary less and less because you will be
            able to look up stuff in your target language.) For
            languages using unfamiliar script(s), dictionary look up
            might be a non-trivial thing to learn. You will probably
            have to learn the equivalent of "alphabetic order" for
            whatever your target language(s) are. I still like to have
            paper dictionaries on hand because often they have
            nice/pretty typesetting and richer grammatical information
            in them than ad-spammed online resources. Information
            dense dictionaries can help you identify and internalize
            patterns quickly, as you can see how <em>words you already
            know are classified into generalizable patterns</em>. On
            my site here, I have some content on specific writing
            systems (e.g.
            this <a href="./languages/chinese/characters.html">article</a>
            on Chinese Characters).
          </p>

          <h3>Finding Tools/References</h3>
          <p>
            The most important thing I look for
            in <span class="term">lexical resources</span> (e.g.
            dictionaries) is either (1) completeness of information
            (e.g. for a European language, indicating declension or
            conjugations patterns) and if possible, (2) <em>lots of
            example sentences</em>. Often better than any explanation
            of how some grammar thing works is the form in
            question <em>in actual use</em>. Many freely accessible
            (as in beer, not freedom) websites provide useful
            dictionaries in many languages. For instance, I often
            use <a href="https://endic.naver.com/?sLn=en">Naver's
            dictionaries</a>, which are available for English, Korean,
            Chinese, Japanese...
          </p>

          <h2>Language Learners in Society</h2>
          <p>
            If you are not a child or a very attractive person (e.g.
            one who possesses great beauty, wealth, etc.), you may
            find language learning difficult. It is time to be humble.
            Most people won't have an automatically given reason to
            talk to you, so it is your job to make yourself worth time
            and attention. Can you be a much better than average
            listener? Will you do some manual labor (e.g. hang out and
            rake some leaves, wash dishes)? What are you willing to do
            to earn the opportunity to siphon some language knowledge?
